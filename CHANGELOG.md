## [v0.9.5] — 2026-05-02

### Reliability sweep + DAX2 coexistence overhaul

A focused stability release.  Headline is **DAX2 coexistence policy
(jensenpat)** — a centralized decision table that makes AetherSDR's
behaviour next to SmartSDR DAX, hosted DAX (macOS / PipeWire), and
external Flex tooling explicit, testable, and consistently logged.
Plus substantial improvements to **disconnect teardown** (sequenced
`stream remove` with response wait — fixes the Flex-6300 unreachable-
after-reconnect bug), **worker-thread shutdown** (no more `killTimer`
warnings on app exit), **panadapter zoom** (no spectrum flash), and
**multi-flex spot/ATU handling** (DXCluster spot trigger_action removal,
ATU per-frequency toggle).

A two-PR **issue triage cleanup** closed 12 long-standing issues across
small UI bugs, contrast, indicator routing, click-to-tune behaviour,
and visible regressions from recent feature work.

### Features

**Aetherial Parametric EQ Smoothing combo (#2236)**
- New Smoothing combo on the EQ analyzer with 1/24, 1/12, 1/6, 1/3,
  1/1 octave fractional smoothing options (linear-power averaging).
  Persists via `EqAnalyzerSmoothing`; defaults to 1/12 octave.
- Audio-domain band-plan strip on the EQ canvas + dashed yellow filter
  cutoff guides for both TX and RX.  Cutoff guides are draggable to
  retune filter edges with mode-aware USB/LSB/AM/FM offset conversion.
- Phone applet Low/High Cut buttons snap to nearest 50 Hz.
- ~30 % faster smoothing inner loop after replacing
  `std::pow(10, x/10)` with `std::exp(x * ln(10)/10)` (#2239).

**Custom filter edges with persistence (#2272)**
- Right-click a filter button → **Set Custom Edges...** opens a
  2-spinbox dialog.  Asymmetric `lo:hi` pairs persist in
  `FilterPresets_<mode>` via a new mixed `width` / `lo:hi` storage
  format (backward compat preserved for existing width-only entries).
- **Reset to Default** is now per-slot.
- FilterPassbandWidget shows signed lo/hi/center values so LSB/CW
  filters reveal sideband.
- Filter-edge grab zone in the spectrum bumped from 5px to 8px so
  edges sitting near the VFO line are easier to grab.

**Spot click client-side mode mapping (#2272)**
- All client-ingested spots (DXCluster, RBN, POTA, SpotCollector,
  FreeDV, WSJT-X, manual) now ship with `trigger_action=none`.  The
  radio no longer auto-acts on stored mode strings (which mishandled
  "SSB" and similar non-Flex tokens, falling back to CW).
- AetherSDR's auto-mode mapping handles tune+mode client-side.
  Default flipped to enabled.
- FreeDV-source spots activate the RADE engine via `activateRADE()`
  (sets DIGU/DIGL plus the OFDM modem) instead of just landing on a
  plain digital mode.

**ATU per-frequency toggle (#2272)**
- ATU button now mirrors SmartSDR's behaviour: first click on a
  frequency tunes; second click at the same frequency bypasses; freq
  change resets the toggle so the next click tunes again.

### Bug fixes

**DAX2 coexistence policy (#2271, jensenpat)**
- New `DaxTxPolicy.h` decision table: `(reason, platform, mode) →
  (allowed, note)`.  Centralizes platform-aware DAX TX decisions with
  explicit reasons (HostedDaxBridge, TciTxAudio, ExternalDaxRouteOnly,
  GenericAudioRecreate) and consistent log notes at every branch.
- Lazy `dax_tx` stream creation via `RadioModel::ensureDaxTxStream()`
  — eager creation at GUI attach is removed so SmartSDR DAX can own
  the Windows route.
- `daxTxStatusCanUpdateLocalState()` anti-stomp: foreign DAX TX
  status can no longer accidentally adopt our tracked stream slot.
- LAN VITA UDP rebind path: on Flex's `0x500000A9` "Port/IP pair
  already in use" error, AetherSDR rebinds to an OS-assigned ephemeral
  port and retries `client udpport`.  WAN/SmartLink already used
  ephemeral ports and is correctly excluded from the rebind path.
- Dead-orphan DAX RX detection: `client_handle=0 ip=0.0.0.0` entries
  are ignored as not-our-stream rather than treated as legacy-compat.
- External DAX TX/RX visibility: separate seen-once log lines so the
  radio's external streams are visible in diagnostic logs without
  polluting our local state.
- 24 + test assertions across `testStreamStatusOwnershipCompatibility`,
  `testDaxTxStatusOwnership`, `testDaxTxPolicy`, and
  `testUdpRegistrationPolicy`.
- Linux non-PipeWire builds correctly skip both `setDax(1)` and DAX
  stream creation, so digital TX falls back to the physical mic input
  rather than going silent (#2273).

**Sequenced radio disconnect teardown (#2247, jensenpat)**
- Fixes Flex-6300 / 6400 unreachability after reconnect (#2113, #2218).
- Disconnect now sends `stream remove 0x<id>` and waits up to 2 s for
  the radio's response before closing TCP.  Without this, fire-and-
  forget teardown left stale Flex sessions that refused subsequent
  connects until reboot.
- Drops the rejected `client disconnect <self_handle>` send — verified
  against FlexLib's own self-disconnect path, which uses the `0x04`
  "dying gasp" byte before TCP close.  AetherSDR now does the same.
- Defensive auto-reconnect arms on refused-connect paths that don't
  emit a `disconnected` signal.

**Worker object shutdown thread affinity (#2248, rfoust)**
- Eliminates `QObject::killTimer: Timers cannot be stopped from
  another thread`, `QObject::moveToThread: Current thread is not the
  object thread`, and `~QObject` warnings on app exit.
- Worker-thread QObjects (audio engine, spot clients, ext controllers,
  radio connection, panadapter stream) are now destroyed via
  `deleteLater()` on their owning threads before each thread quits.

**Panadapter zoom keeps spectrum visible (#2246, rfoust)**
- New `reprojectSpectrum()` mirrors the existing waterfall reprojection.
  Zoom changes that overlap with the previous range now interpolate
  existing FFT bins forward instead of clearing them, eliminating the
  spectrum flash/blank during pinch / wheel / drag zoom.

**TGXL detected via direct TCP only (#2250, chrisb1964)**
- TUN applet now appears for TGXLs that don't report through the
  amplifier API (Flex-8600 fw 4.2.18).  New `m_directPresence` fallback
  in `TunerModel`; `isPresent()` returns true via either path.
- Handles bare `amplifier <handle> removed` form correctly via a new
  `ampRemovedRe` regex (matches FlexLib's `s.Contains("removed")`
  semantics for both bare-flag and kvs-form removals).

**RX slice tab capacity initialization (#2243, chibondking)**
- RX slice tab capacity is now seeded from the radio model on connect
  rather than left at the default — fixes empty tabs when reconnecting
  to a different radio model.

**Radio model label refresh (#2244, jensenpat)**
- Radio model label refreshes on `info` command response, so
  reconnecting to a different model immediately reflects the new
  identity in the UI.

**FreeDV Reporter OS string (#2269, tmiw)**
- OS field lowercased to match the official FreeDV client convention.
  Previously AetherSDR users showed as "other" in monthly platform
  reports.  Thanks Mooneer.

**FreeDV Reporter checkbox visibility (#2268, NF0T)**
- Three checkboxes in the FreeDV Reporter tab were rendering with no
  visible borders against the dark background.  Applied the standard
  `ConnectionPanel` checkbox style.

**AppletPanel scrollbar (#2257, Chaosuk97)**
- AppletPanel scrollbar widened from 6 px to 12 px with a dim handle
  at rest that brightens to `#4a6880` on hover or drag.  500 ms
  delay before dimming back so quick scroll gestures don't flicker.
  Always-visible track to match the rest of the app.

**Sweep 1 — 7 small UI / contrast fixes (#2270)**
- `AetherSDR vX.Y.Z` shown again in the in-app title bar — restored
  after the frameless-window mode regression (#2027).
- FlexControl knob press tokens are bare `S` / `C` / `L`, not
  `X4S` / `X4C` / `X4L`.  Captured against LB2EG's hardware (#2263).
- Å Morse sequence corrected to `01101` (`·−−·−`) per ITU-R M.1677-1
  (#2264, LB2EG).
- Single-click-to-tune suppressed across the entire K / SFI / WNB /
  RF Gain / WIDE indicator strip in the top-right of the spectrum,
  not just the propagation text (#1564).
- Slice record (⏺) and play (▶) indicator alpha values doubled for
  legibility against the dark spectrum background (#1576).
- Status indicators (TNF / CWX / DVK / FDX) unified to cyan
  (`#00b4d8`) for active and dark grey (`#404858`) for off; TNF init
  colour bug fixed (was semi-transparent white) (#1581).
- Status bar time stack: removed grid-square label; date + UTC time
  use the same 2-row layout as every other telemetry stack (#1583).

**Sweep 2 — 5 small bug fixes (#2272)**
- Double-clicking an off-screen slice indicator (`<A` / `A>`) recenters
  cleanly without retuning to a wrong frequency (#2237).  Qt's
  press → release → double-click → release sequence was leaving
  `m_spotClickConsumed=false` on the trailing release, so the
  single-click-to-tune path fired against the new center.
- HAVE_RADE without HAVE_WEBSOCKETS compile error (#2204) —
  `startFreeDvReporting` / `stopFreeDvReporting` now wrap their
  bodies with `#ifndef HAVE_WEBSOCKETS` no-op fallback.
- (See "Features" above for #1846 spot mode, #1993 ATU toggle, #2259
  custom filter edges.)

## [v0.9.4] — 2026-05-01

### AetherSweep, ShackSwitch, and multi-client startup hardening

A heavy community-contribution release.  Headline feature is **AetherSweep**
(jensenpat) — an in-panadapter SWR sweep analyzer that walks the current TX
band, plots SWR live on the spectrum surface, and handles TGXL bypass +
external-amplifier safety.  **ShackSwitch** support (nigelfenton) lands as a
new Peripherals tab + dedicated applet, integrating any builder's open-source
Arduino antenna switch over the Antenna Genius protocol.

A trio of substantial reliability fixes from jensenpat addresses long-standing
multi-client startup issues — when SmartSDR or DAX is already connected,
AetherSDR's panadapter creation, slice ownership, and PC audio stream
acquisition now all hold up under the racey status interleavings the
ShackSwitch and DAX users were hitting.  Plus a focused mix of platform
fixes: macOS DMG dark-theme on pop-out windows (Chaosuk97), Windows
without-Qt6::SerialPort build (NF0T), NRL gating correctness on 6000-series
radios.

### Features

**AetherSweep — in-panadapter SWR analyzer (#2202, #2220, #2230, jensenpat)**
- New Start/Clear Sweep buttons under the ANT slice menu, plus a 1-10 W
  sweep-power slider with cross-panel sync.  Persisted as
  `SwrSweepPowerWatts` and defaults to 1 W.
- Walks the current TX band stepping a tune carrier in 20 kHz increments
  with edge guards, sampling fresh SWR + forward-power meter data per step,
  and overlays the curve on the panadapter directly under the slice flag.
- Per-band-edge guard, max-260-points cap, and 60 m channelized-band
  refusal.  Refuses to start when split is active, when transmitting,
  when the band is wider than the radio's max pan width, or when a PGXL
  amplifier is in OPERATE mode (forces user to STANDBY first).
- ⚠️  **Third-party amplifiers are not auto-detected.** AetherSweep
  only knows how to put a Power Genius XL into standby — it has no way
  to talk to ACOM, SPE, Elecraft KPA, OM Power, or other linear amps.
  **If you have a non-PGXL amplifier, manually place it in BYPASS or
  STANDBY before starting an SWR sweep.**  The sweep will run a tune
  carrier through whatever path the radio sees, and a non-bypassed
  external linear will amplify that carrier into your antenna.
- Full TGXL handling: snapshots OPERATE/BYPASS state, places TGXL into
  BYPASS to read raw antenna SWR, restores original state on completion
  or abort.  Reads radio-side SWR while TGXL is bypassed (TGXL stops
  emitting RL meter packets in bypass — #2229).
- 5-phase state machine with explicit timeouts: WaitingForTgxlBypass,
  TgxlBypassSettle, Sweeping, StoppingTune, RestoringTgxl.
- Esc to abort.  Inputs locked during sweep so the user can't accidentally
  retune mid-pass.  Disconnect mid-sweep cleanly stops the carrier and
  releases TGXL.
- Optimistic `setTunePower()` update so the sweep's chosen power lands
  immediately rather than racing the radio's status echo.
- Sweep result label shows source — `RADIO` for direct measurement,
  `TGXL BYPASS` for tuner-bypassed measurement.

**ShackSwitch antenna switch integration (#2214, #2227, nigelfenton)**
- New **Peripherals** tab in Radio Setup with auto-discovery and manual-IP
  connect for ShackSwitch devices via the Antenna Genius (AG) UDP/TCP
  protocol on port 9007.
- New **ShackSwitchApplet** — compact panel with up to 8 labelled
  antenna-port buttons, click-to-switch, active-port highlight.  SO2R
  dual-radio mode shows Input A / Input B side-by-side with conflict
  detection.  Single-radio mode (4-port R4 hardware) hides Input B
  automatically.
- Dummy-load / deselect (clicking the active port deselects it) and
  per-port labels driven by the device's own configuration.
- Integration is invisible to users without ShackSwitch hardware —
  detected by the `name="ShackSwitch"` field in the AG broadcast beacon.
- Web UI launcher button opens the device's local web interface.
- Reference hardware: ShackSwitch v2.0 (Arduino Uno Q, SO2R, 8-port) and
  ShackSwitch R4 (Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, single-radio, 4-port).

### Bug fixes

**Multi-client startup panadapter creation (#2222, jensenpat)**
- AetherSDR's startup pan creation now holds up cleanly when SmartSDR,
  DAX, or another GUI/audio client is already connected.  The radio
  replays status for all current pans/slices/streams on connect; without
  this fix, AetherSDR could correctly reject other clients' objects but
  then fail to instantiate its own `PanadapterModel` if ownership status
  arrived out of order.
- Adds `display panafall create x=100 y=100` (FlexLib v4.2.18 syntax)
  with capability-based fallback to legacy `panadapter create`.
- New `ensureOwnedPanadapter()` factory; deferred-status replay queue
  for `display pan` frames that arrive without `client_handle`; waterfall
  ordering recovery via `panadapter=...` parent ID lookup.
- Routes failure cases through the existing `panadapterLimitReached` /
  `sliceCreateFailed` status-bar signals so radio resource exhaustion
  is visible instead of looking like a startup hang.

**PC audio remote stream ownership (#2226, jensenpat)**
- Fixes PC Audio failure when SmartSDR / DAX is already running — the
  shared `remote_audio_rx` pipe was being silently removed because
  AetherSDR was parsing the `stream create` response body as decimal
  instead of hex.  `"4000009"` (no `0x` prefix) was becoming
  `0x003D0F09` instead of `0x04000009`, so the create-response stream
  didn't match the status-reported stream and AetherSDR removed the
  real one.
- Extracts a new `RadioStatusOwnership` helper (header-only, fully
  unit-tested) that handles ownership decisions for both panadapters
  and remote audio streams — defer when no `client_handle`, claim
  when ours, ignore when another client's.
- Stream-acquisition state machine now tracks create-pending,
  remove-requested, and adopted-from-status separately so toggling
  PC Audio doesn't race the create response.
- Adds `radio_status_ownership_test` with 25 assertions covering all
  the ownership decisions and the headline parse bug.
- Fixes #2037, #1418, #1473.

**TGXL meter goes silent during bypass (#2229, #2230)**
- AetherSweep aborted with "no fresh TGXL SWR meter data" whenever the
  TGXL was in OPERATE before sweep start.  The TGXL stops emitting `RL`
  (return-loss) meter packets while in BYPASS — bypass relays are
  passive wire-through, no measurement engine.
- Switches the meter source to RADIO while the TGXL is bypassed; the
  radio's own SWR coupler measures the same physical signal through
  the bypassed relays.  UI label still shows `TGXL BYPASS` since
  that's what describes the configuration.

**Pop-out applet panel white background on macOS (#2190, Chaosuk97)**
- macOS DMG builds rendered floating windows with a white background
  even though the dark-theme stylesheet was applied — the CI-built
  `libqcocoa.dylib` enforced `Qt::WA_StyledBackground` more strictly
  than Homebrew's Qt 6.11.0 build.
- Adds `setAttribute(Qt::WA_StyledBackground, true)` on all three
  floating-window classes (`FloatingContainerWindow`, `PanFloatingWindow`,
  `MainWindow::floatAppletPanel`).  Cross-platform safe: the attribute
  is harmless on Linux/Windows where it was a no-op, and now the
  pop-out applet panel correctly themed on every platform (was
  defaulting to system theme on Linux/Windows too — latent bug fixed
  as a side effect).

**Windows build without Qt6::SerialPort (#2195, NF0T)**
- Compile error introduced by #2147: the `<QElapsedTimer>` include was
  guarded by `#ifdef HAVE_SERIALPORT` while `m_debounceTimer` is declared
  under `#if defined(HAVE_SERIALPORT) || defined(Q_OS_WIN)`.  Mismatch
  broke the Windows-without-SerialPort build configuration.  Widens the
  include guard to match.

**NRL DSP filter visible on 6000-series radios (#2219)**
- Fixes regression from #2184 where NRL was incorrectly grouped with
  the 8000-series-only firmware DSP filters (NRS, RNN, NRF).  NRL is
  available on 6000-series too — only NRS/RNN/NRF require BigBend /
  DragonFire hardware.  Fixes #2198.

### Acknowledgements

Massive contributor batch this cycle:

- **jensenpat** — AetherSweep (3 PRs: feature + power-control polish + TGXL
  meter fix), multi-client panadapter startup, PC audio ownership.  This
  release wouldn't be the leap it is without his work.
- **nigelfenton** — ShackSwitch integration (3 PRs across the cycle:
  protocol fix, full integration, callsign-detection cleanup).
- **NF0T** — Windows build fix.
- **Chaosuk97** — macOS DMG dark-theme fix.

## [v0.9.3] — 2026-04-30

### External APD, FreeDV Reporter, Slice Colors, and v4.2 firmware updater

A broad release.  Headline feature is **External APD** support for
SmartSDR firmware 4.2.18, which lets the radio sample its outgoing
RF from a coupled feedback path on one of the RX/XVTR inputs so the
predistortion engine trains against the actual transmitted signal —
required when a FLEX-8x00 drives an external linear amplifier.
**FreeDV Reporter** station reporting (NF0T) lands the long-requested
RADE-integrated reporting flow.  **chibondking** ships customizable
slice colors plus two serial / pop-out fixes.  AetherSDR's firmware
updater is rewritten to extract `.ssdr` files natively from
FlexRadio's v4.2+ MSI installer (no bundled tools needed), and the
NAVTEX data-layer plumbing lands ahead of the upcoming applet.

A long tail of UI polish and Windows-platform fixes also lands —
TX→RX waterfall continuity, scroll-wheel debounce, 48 kHz audio
sink on Windows, applet pop-out persistence, and floating-window
dark theming.

### Features

**External APD (#2187)**
- New "APD" tab in Radio Setup with per-TX-antenna external sampler
  selection (ANT1 / ANT2 / XVTA / XVTB → INTERNAL / RX_A / RX_B /
  XVTA / XVTB).  Tab is hidden unless the radio reports `apd
  configurable=1`, so it stays invisible on 6000-series radios and
  pre-4.2.18 firmware.
- Equalizer Reset button issues `apd reset` to clear all per-antenna
  training data.
- Protocol additions: `apd sampler` sub-object parsing (with
  fallback-to-INTERNAL for invalid `selected_sampler`), bare
  `equalizer_reset` flag handling, and the matching `setApdSamplerPort`
  command path on `TransmitModel`.
- Cross-checked against `Flex.Smoothlake.FlexLib` v4.2.18 source.

**FreeDV Reporter station reporting with RADE integration (#2173, NF0T)**
- Adds FreeDV Reporter (https://qso.freedv.org) station-reporting
  support driven by the RADE modem's sync / SNR / freq-offset events.
- New connection toggle in the DX Cluster dialog plus per-slice
  reporting toggle that mirrors RADE engine state to the Reporter
  WebSocket session.
- Builds opportunistically — without `Qt6::WebSockets` or `librade`,
  the toggles silently become no-ops.

**Customizable slice colors (#2155, chibondking)**
- Per-slice color selection through a new `SliceColorManager`
  singleton.  Color assignments persist across sessions and are
  visible in VFO widgets, panadapter overlays, and meter strips.

**Native MSI firmware installer support (#2169)**
- The firmware updater can now extract `.ssdr` files directly from
  FlexRadio's v4.2.18+ MSI installer (which switched from PE/COFF
  self-extracting `.exe` to WiX 6 MSI).  Vendored `libmspack`
  (LGPL-2.1) handles LZX-compressed CABs; a small OLE Compound File
  reader pulls the embedded CAB from the MSI envelope.
- "Browse .ssdr" → "Select Installer..." now accepts `.msi`, `.exe`,
  and `.ssdr`.  No external tools required (no `7z`, no MSI runtime).
- Format auto-detection on the first 8 bytes (OLE magic vs. PE/COFF MZ).

**NAVTEX data-layer plumbing (#2186)**
- New `NavtexModel` covers the SmartSDR `navtex` waveform protocol —
  per-message Pending → Queued → Sent / Error state, status parsing
  for `navtex` and `navtex sent`, and a `navtex send` command path
  with proper quote/backslash escaping for `msg_text`.
- Foundation for the upcoming NAVTEX applet UI; data layer ships
  first so other clients (TCI, scripting) can already publish NAVTEX
  traffic.
- 21-assertion unit test covers escaping, idempotency, error paths.

**CWX active tracking (#2181)**
- `RadioModel` tracks CWX send state so the audio gate stays open
  during long character sends.

**Floating-window dark theme (#2096, AetherClaude)**
- Pop-out panadapter and floating-container windows now inherit the
  full dark theme via a new `Theme.h` shared stylesheet, eliminating
  flash-of-light-theme on window construction.

**Center active VFO when zooming in from keyboard (#2183, jensenpat)**
- The keyboard zoom-in shortcut now centers the active VFO in the
  viewport (matches the mouse-wheel zoom behavior).

### Bug fixes

**TX→RX waterfall continuity (#2171, #2182)**
- Force FFT-fallback rendering on TX→RX transition to prevent a
  visible gap in the waterfall (#2171).
- Blank waterfall rows for 400 ms after TX ends so any residual
  hardware tail doesn't paint over the noise floor (#2182).

**Hide 8000-series DSP filters on 6000-series radios (#2184)**
- `NRL`, `NRS`, `RNN`, `NRF` filters are FLEX-8x00-only.  6000-series
  radios no longer show greyed-out controls for filters they can't
  use.

**Stream-status helper consolidation (#2145)**
- Deduplicates the per-stream-type status helpers.  Annotates
  `m_daxTxClientHandle` and documents the TCI receiver-index policy
  for future contributors.

**TCP close handshake before socket destroy (#2113)**
- Wait for `disconnected()` before tearing down the QTcpSocket on
  user-initiated disconnect.  Fixes occasional "connection reset"
  reports on the radio side.

**rigctld short-form split direction (#2111)**
- `S` (set split) and `s` (get split) were transposed in the rigctld
  mapping table, so external loggers couldn't read or set split.

**CW sidetone on Windows (#2105)**
- `startSidetoneStream()` was never called on Windows because the
  audio backend init order put it after the first key event.  CW
  sidetone now starts immediately on connect.

**48 kHz RX audio sink on Windows (#2123)**
- Prefer 48 kHz over 24 kHz on Windows where WASAPI's resampler
  introduces audible high-frequency artifacts at 24 kHz.

**Scrollbar styling on applet panels (#2088)**
- The applet-panel scroll area was inheriting Qt's default thin grey
  scrollbar; restyles to the dark-theme bar.

**USB mic level gauge on connect (#2086)**
- The USB mic-level gauge wasn't drawn when connecting with `mic
  source = PC`; gauge now appears immediately.

**VOX phoneStateChanged on keyboard shortcut (#2084)**
- VOX setters didn't emit `phoneStateChanged()`, so the UI didn't
  refresh when VOX was toggled via keyboard shortcut.

**Scroll-wheel debounce (#2151)**
- Debounces high-frequency `pixelDelta` scroll events from
  precision-scroll mice in `VfoWidget` and `SpectrumWidget`.

**Marker-width settings cleanup (#2156, mvanhorn)**
- `Slice<N>_MarkerThin` setting key is now removed after migration
  to `Slice<N>_MarkerWidth` instead of being left in place.

**Serial PTT — Win32 WaitCommEvent path (#2147, chibondking)**
- FTDI VCP drivers only refresh DSR/CTS in the completion of a
  `WaitCommEvent` call; AetherSDR's polling-based detection missed
  edges on Windows.  Adds a Win32 native event-wait path on top of
  Qt's serial port for DSR detection.

**Applet pop-out persistence race (#2154, chibondking)**
- Floating applet windows were sometimes restored at the wrong
  position because the geometry-save signal raced the close event.
  Systemic fix wires save before destruction.

**Windows build guard for FreeDV Reporter (#2186)**
- The FreeDV Reporter `freedvReportingToggled` connect-lambda used
  RADE-guarded symbols inside an `#ifdef HAVE_WEBSOCKETS` block.
  Windows has WebSockets but no RADE → undefined-identifier compile
  errors.  Added the missing `HAVE_RADE` inner guard.

### Docs

- **Data-modes help refresh (#1939)** — replaces lingering "DIGI
  applet" references with the current independent-tile UI vocabulary.
- **DIGI applet scrub (#2179)** — sweeps the remaining stale
  references in tooltips and dialog text.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to **NF0T** for the FreeDV Reporter station-reporting
integration; **chibondking** for slice colors, the serial PTT
WaitCommEvent fix, and the applet pop-out race; **jensenpat** for
the keyboard zoom-center shortcut; **mvanhorn** for the marker-key
cleanup; and **AetherClaude** for the bulk of the long-tail bug
fixes.

## [v0.9.2.1] — 2026-04-29

### TGXL direct autotune for firmware 4.2 compatibility

Hotfix release.  After upgrading to SmartSDR firmware 4.2, multiple
users on both AetherSDR and SmartSDR report the TUNE button no longer
works on the 4O3A Tuner Genius XL.  The radio's `tgxl autotune` command
path was reworked in 4.2 firmware and broke for many configurations.

This release routes the TUNE button through the TGXL's native
port-9010 channel when a direct TGXL connection is configured,
bypassing the affected firmware path.  Users without a direct TGXL
connection are unaffected by this change and should still configure
direct connection in Radio Setup → Tuner to recover TUNE.

### Bug Fixes

**TGXL TUNE works again on firmware 4.2 (#2163)**
- When a direct TGXL connection (port 9010) is configured, the TUNE
  button now sends the native `autotune` command directly to the TGXL
  instead of routing `tgxl autotune handle=<H>` through the radio's
  command channel.  Falls back to the radio path when no direct
  connection is available.
- The TGXL drives radio PTT via its hardware interlock cable when it
  receives the native `autotune` command, so client-side keying is
  not required.  Existing tuning state and SWR readout in the Tuner
  applet are unchanged.

**Log redaction no longer mangles 4-component version strings**
- The PII redactor's IPv4 regex matched anything that looked like
  four dot-separated 1-3-digit numbers, so the application's own
  version string `0.9.2.1` was being redacted to `*.*.*. 1` in
  logs and support bundles.  Negative lookbehind/lookahead now skip
  quoted (`"0.9.2.1"`) and v-prefixed (`v0.9.2.1`) version forms
  while still redacting bare IPs in log output.

## [v0.9.2] — 2026-04-28

### WAVE Phase 2, v4.2.18 firmware support, and community polish

A focused community-driven release.  Major work from **jensenpat** lands
the WAVE Phase 2 applet (four visualizations, settings drawer), proper
TCXO frequency-offset calibration, and the DAX/TCI multi-stream routing
needed for FlexRadio firmware 4.2.18.  **chibondking** and **NF0T**
ship a serial PTT fix and an r8b heap-corruption crash fix.  The VFO
DSP panel gets a UX pass (collapsed Marker + Filter Edge buttons), and
the v4.2.18 discovery beacon is parsed.

### Features

**WAVE Phase 2 — applet visualization controls (#2124, jensenpat)**
- Double-click the WAVE waveform to open a settings drawer (replaces
  the prior clear-on-double-click behavior).  Drawer is open by default
  on first launch for discoverability.
- New compact `View` dropdown with four visualizations:
  Scope (the original waveform trace), Envelope (filled RMS with peak
  outline), History (side-scrolling activity bars), Bands (vertical
  EQ-style frequency bands).
- Persisted Zoom and FPS controls in the drawer.  Zoom is amplitude
  gain across all views, not a time-window preference.
- Drawer participates in the applet size hint when expanded so the
  applet stays compact when collapsed.

**DAX-aware TCI multi-stream routing (#2140, jensenpat)**
- Adapts the DAX/TCI audio path for FlexRadio firmware 4.2.18's
  explicit stream-ownership reporting.  Filters DAX RX/IQ stream
  status by `client_handle` so we don't accidentally register another
  client's stream, while accepting ownership-less status from older
  firmware.
- Advertises TCI receivers as contiguous owned-slice indexes
  (`0..N-1`) rather than raw Flex slice IDs.  Fixes WSJT-X TCI1/TCI2
  multi-slice operation when this client owns slice 1 but another
  client owns slice 0.
- Honors per-client `audio_start:<receiver>` so multi-slice WSJT-X
  receives only the intended audio.
- Stream-removal handling: unregisters DAX/IQ streams and clears TCI
  DAX placeholders on `removed` status.
- Adds focused diagnostics for first DAX VITA packets, TCI receiver
  maps, DAX RX delivery, and DAX TX route selection — gated behind
  `lcDax` / `lcCat` categories so default users see no extra noise.

**TCXO frequency-offset calibration (#2119, jensenpat)**
- Replaces the unsupported `radio calibrate` command (firmware
  v4.1.5 returns `0x50000016` "unknown command") with the documented
  SmartSDR / FlexLib sequence: `radio set cal_freq=`, `radio set
  freq_error_ppb=0`, `radio pll_start`.
- Watches `pll_done` status for completion with run-specific guards
  against stale events from a prior calibration firing during a new
  run.
- Cross-checked against FlexLib v2.10.1 source.  Fixes #1237, #2095.

**VFO marker controls — tri-state Marker, single Filter Edge (#2141)**
- The four-button row (Thin / Thick / Edges / Hide) collapses to two:
  - **Marker** cycles `Off → 1 px → 3 px` on click.  Off skips both
    the center line and the top triangle, leaving only the passband
    bracket.
  - **Filter Edge** is a checkable on/off — checked = edges shown.
- New `Slice<N>_MarkerWidth` int settings key with one-shot migration
  from the old `Slice<N>_MarkerThin` bool (`True` → 1, `False` → 3).

**v4.2.18 discovery beacon parsing (#2138, AetherClaude)**
- Parses two new fields from the FlexLib v4.2.18 discovery packet:
  `is_system_model` (flags bench / system-build radios) and
  `turf_region` (turf region indicator distinct from the existing
  `region` field).  `turf_region` is shown in the connect dialog
  detail line.

**Other**
- ATU start added to the keyboard shortcut actions list.
- Clear action added to the CW decode window context menu (#2116).

### Bug fixes

**Resampler heap corruption (#2114, NF0T)**
- `r8b::CDSPResampler24::process()` doesn't bounds-check its `l`
  parameter; passing a block larger than the constructor's
  `aMaxInLen` silently overflows internal filter buffers.  Bug
  manifested as a crash when the Qt event loop stalled long enough
  for `QAudioSource::readAll()` to return more than 4096 frames in
  one call (typical during DX-cluster spot bursts or heavy UI
  redraws).  Fix: chunk-and-recurse on each `process*()` path so each
  call stays within the configured limit.

**Serial PTT input non-functional (#2125, chibondking)**
- Three layered bugs blocked the serial-PTT path:
  1. No way to open the port without restarting AetherSDR — the
     Serial tab had no Open / Close buttons and the auto-open label
     implied a restart was required.
  2. `loadSettings()` defaulted CTS / DSR polarity to `ActiveLow`
     while the dialog combo defaulted to "Active High".  Users who
     left polarity at the displayed default got silently inverted
     logic — footswitch press read as inactive, PTT never fired.
  3. `updatePolling()` was missed when the port was opened, so the
     polling loop didn't pick up the configured input function.
- Adds Open / Close buttons to the Serial tab, fixes the polarity
  default mismatch, and tracks the explicit Open state separately
  from auto-open via a new `SerialPortOpen` setting.

**Slice audio loss after band changes (#2128, jensenpat)**
- After `display pan set band=`, the radio sometimes stops mixing
  slice audio without echoing `audio_mute=1`, leaving the model in a
  "unmuted but silent" state.  Fix: 300 ms after the band-change
  command, reassert `slice set <N> audio_mute=0` for any unmuted
  slice on that pan.

**CWX Live toggle and Send action (#2122, jensenpat)**
- `Live` button is now a true toggle so operators can turn live
  keying back off (was force-on only).
- `Send` button now submits the current input when Live is off
  (matching Enter-key behavior).
- Setup exits Live cleanly without duplicate-sending text already
  keyed character-by-character.
- Adds `cwx_panel_test` covering Live toggling, Send-click
  submission, Enter submission, and Live exit safety.

**Connect-radio dialog grouping polish (#2121, jensenpat)**
- Scopes the `QFrame` callout stylesheet so child labels and
  checkboxes don't inherit the panel border / background, fixing
  nested-bordered-box rendering on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Tightens the SmartLink Remote radio list height and moves the
  Connect Remote button outside the Remote group.

### Internal

- `bool m_markerThin` → `int m_markerWidth` (0 / 1 / 3) propagated
  through `VfoWidget`, `SpectrumWidget::SliceOverlay`, and the
  `markerStyleChanged` signal.  Render path skips both the center
  line and the top triangle when `markerWidth == 0`.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to **jensenpat** for the WAVE Phase 2, DAX/TCI, calibration,
band-change, CWX, and dialog polish work; **chibondking** for the
serial PTT triple-fix; and **NF0T** for catching the r8b heap-
corruption bug.

## [v0.9.1] — 2026-04-27

### Local iambic CW keyer, unified sidetone controls, and CW transmit reliability

A focused follow-up to v0.9.0.  The headline feature is a software
iambic keyer that turns any MIDI / serial paddle into a sub-5 ms
sidetone source via the new PortAudio backend (issue #2079) — the
radio still produces the on-air signal, but the local sidetone
gate fires the moment the paddle moves instead of waiting for the
radio's keyed-back signal.  Three latent bugs in the netcw protocol
path that prevented CW from ever transmitting on FLEX-8600 v4.1.5
firmware are also fixed.  Plus the CW panel collapses three sidetone
widget groups into one set of controls and finally wires up the L/R
pan slider that's been a placeholder since the panel was first added.

### Features

**Local iambic keyer for sub-5 ms paddle sidetone (#2079)**
- Software iambic state machine that runs alongside the radio's RF
  iambic engine.  Both engines see the same paddle inputs at the same
  WPM and produce identical Morse timing — but the local keyer drives
  the sidetone gate directly, avoiding the 50–200 ms round-trip
  through the radio's keyed-back signal.
- Modes A and B implemented (Ultimatic / Bug / Straight follow in a
  later phase).  Hooked into both MIDI Gate params (`cw.dit`,
  `cw.dah`) and serial paddle paths (DTR/CTS via SerialPortController).
- Driven by the existing radio Iambic toggle — no new UI clutter.
  The keyer mirrors the radio's iambic state, mode, and WPM via the
  TransmitModel `phoneStateChanged` signal.
- Dedicated worker thread with `std::chrono::steady_clock` timing
  and a lock-free atomic key gate on the audio side.  9 unit tests
  covering single dit/dah timing, squeeze alternation, inter-element
  gap, mode A release behaviour, WPM scaling, paddle swap, idempotent
  start, and idle behaviour.

**Sidetone controls unified (#2079)**
- The CW panel previously had three separate sidetone widget groups:
  the radio's "Sidetone" toggle/volume, a "Local STn" toggle/volume
  for the local PortAudio sidetone, and a "Follow" pitch row with a
  manual override slider.  All three are now collapsed into the
  single existing **Sidetone** button, which drives both engines in
  lockstep.  The volume slider drives `mon_gain_cw` on the radio and
  the local sidetone identically.  Pitch always follows the radio's
  `cw_pitch`.

**CW pan slider wired up (#2079)**
- The L/R pan slider in the CW panel was a dead UI element with a
  TODO comment.  Now drives both the radio's `mon_pan_cw` (radio-side
  sidetone pan within the RX audio stream) and the local sidetone
  with constant-power pan law (cosine/sine for equal-loudness sweep,
  no center dip).  Double-click on the slider recenters to 50.

**Slice capacity notification (#48)**
- Status-bar warning when adding another panadapter would exceed the
  radio's slice limit.  Three guard points cover the pre-flight check
  in the layout dialog, the runtime check in `applyPanLayout`, and
  the async fallback when the radio rejects a `panafall create`.
  Includes the radio model name and slice count in the message.

**PortAudio sidetone via JACK on Linux (#2075 follow-up)**
- The PortAudio sidetone backend (introduced in v0.9.0) now prefers
  the JACK host API on Linux when available, with `paFramesPerBuffer
  = 128` + `suggestedLatency = 0` for sub-5 ms quantum.  PipeWire's
  ALSA shim silently breaks callback-mode streams on some setups
  (`Pa_StartStream` returns success but the audio thread never
  schedules the callback); pipewire-jack delivers reliable callbacks
  at the device's native sample rate.  48 kHz is now the universal
  preference, with `Pa_IsFormatSupported` guarding fallback.

### Bug fixes

**CW transmit: invalid paddle command form**
- `RadioModel::sendCwPaddle` was emitting `cw key 1 0` (a 2-arg paddle
  form) which the radio's protocol does not accept — FlexLib only
  ever sends single-state `cw key 1` or `cw key 0` and expects the
  client to do iambic timing locally.  The 2-arg form was silently
  dropped, so paddle keying produced no RF.  Now collapses to a
  straight-key form when the local iambic keyer isn't running, or
  routes through the new `sendCwKeyEdge` + `sendCwPtt` primitives
  when it is.

**CW transmit: lowercase hex in netcw payload**
- FlexLib formats `time=0x...` and `client_handle=0x...` with C#
  `ToString("X")` (uppercase), and the radio's status messages do
  too (e.g. `S23A59BDF|...`).  Firmware v4.1.5's netcw parser is
  case-sensitive on these fields and silently dropped lowercase
  packets.  Now formatted explicitly uppercase.

**CW transmit: dead TCP fallback**
- The post-UDP TCP fallback was sending the netcw-decorated form
  (`cw key 1 time=0x... index=... client_handle=0x...`) which the
  radio rejects with `0x50001000` ("command syntax error") on TCP.
  Removed when the netcw stream is up; the no-netcw fallback (for
  firmware that doesn't support netcw stream creation) is preserved
  separately.

**Optimistic updates for CW model setters**
- `setCwIambic`, `setCwIambicMode`, `setCwSpeed`, and `setCwPitch`
  on `TransmitModel` previously sent the command to the radio
  without updating local state, on the assumption that the radio
  would echo the new value back.  Firmware v1.4.0.0 doesn't reliably
  echo iambic flags, WPM, or pitch in transmit status messages, so
  any code reading these properties after a UI toggle saw stale
  values until the next periodic transmit status arrived (or never).
  Now follow the same optimistic-update pattern as `setCwBreakIn`.

**Block on graceful disconnect (#1996, openstreem)**
- `RadioModel::disconnectFromRadio` now uses `Qt::BlockingQueued
  Connection` for both the `gracefulDisconnect` lambda and the
  fallback `disconnectFromRadio` call, matching the destructor's
  pattern.  Without this, the queued work could be cancelled before
  it ran during app teardown — leaving the radio with a stale
  session that required a power cycle.

**Memory recall: restore repeater offset and tone (#1871, #1965, jensenpat)**
- Recalled FM repeater memories properly restore `repeater_offset_dir`,
  `fm_repeater_offset_freq`, derived `tx_offset_freq`, and CTCSS tone
  state.  Previously, switching from a repeater memory to simplex
  could leave stale TX offset state on the slice.

**`m_activeTxSlice` initializer mismatch (#2076)**
- Default-init was `0` but `clear()` sets to `-1`.  Now both default
  to `-1` so a fresh `MeterModel` and a cleared one have identical
  `activeTxSlice()` state.

**Per-slice compression meter resolution (#2073)**
- TX-chain `COMPPEAK`, `AFTEREQ`, and `SC_MIC` meters are now
  resolved per active slice instead of last-match-wins, fixing
  Multi-Flex setups where the wrong slice's compression value was
  surfaced in the UI.

**ContainerWidget restoreState displaces children**
- `restoreState` re-inserted children at indices 0..N–1 even when
  they were already in the layout, displacing non-saved children
  like the CHAIN widget.  `insertChildWidget` is now a no-op when
  the child is already present.

### Build and CI

- `M_PI_2` replaced with a local `kPiOver2` constexpr in
  `CwSidetoneGenerator.cpp` so the Windows MSVC build doesn't
  fail (`<cmath>` doesn't define `M_PI_2` without `_USE_MATH_DEFINES`).

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to the operators who tested CW workflows on real hardware
and surfaced the netcw protocol issues that had been silent since
the netcw backend landed, and to **jensenpat** and **openstreem**
for the community fixes bundled in.

## [v0.9.0] — 2026-04-25

### Aetherial RX Audio Suite, frameless UI, and local CW sidetone

A milestone release. The PooDoo Audio chain — Aetherial Parametric EQ,
AGC-T gate, AGC-C compressor, Tube saturator, and PUDU exciter — now
runs on **both** RX and TX with independent settings, drag-to-reorder
on each path, and matching frameless editor windows.  The whole UI
goes frameless: the main window plus every applet pop-out and editor
gets a Discord-style minimise / maximise / close trio with title-bar
drag.  CW operators get a dedicated low-latency local sidetone sink
that survives CWX too.  Plus community fixes for the FLEX-6000
compression meter, RTTY mark-default reset, RADE decoded audio, and
the usual stack of UX polish.

### Features

**PooDoo Audio RX chain (#1998)**
- Reuses the existing TX DSP modules (Parametric EQ, gate/expander,
  compressor, tube saturator, PUDU exciter) on the RX path with
  fully independent state from TX.  Each stage is a tile in the
  CHAIN widget on the RX side: single-click toggles bypass,
  double-click opens the floating editor.  RX chain order is
  drag-to-reorder.  RADIO and SPEAK status tiles bookend the chain;
  the DSP tile shows whichever client-side noise reducer is active
  (NR2 / NR4 / BNR).
- All applet titles rebrand to **Aetherial**: Parametric EQ,
  AGC-T (gate), AGC-C (compressor), Tube, PUDU.

**Frameless main window with custom title bar (#1926)**
- Main window now uses `Qt::FramelessWindowHint` with a custom
  20 px title bar carrying drag-to-move via `startSystemMove`,
  double-click maximise, and a Discord-style minimise / maximise /
  close trio.  Resize via standard window-edge grip.

**Frameless pop-out windows for applets and panadapters (#1922)**
- Every floating applet and panadapter pop-out gains the same
  frameless title bar with the trio.  Single-click trio actions,
  drag the bar to move, double-click to maximise.

**Frameless editor windows for the entire PooDoo chain (#1998)**
- Aetherial Parametric EQ, AGC-T, AGC-C, Tube, PUDU, and Reverb
  editors all use the same shared title-bar widget with drag and
  trio.  Title text reads "Aetherial &lt;Stage&gt; — &lt;Side&gt;" so the
  TX vs RX instance is identifiable at a glance.

**Polish frameless title bar (#1931)**
- Title-bar trio refined to a Discord-style sequence; dropped the
  lightbulb icon in favour of a minimal arrow accent so the trio
  sits flush against the right edge.

**Local CW sidetone with low-latency sink + CWX support (#1969)**
- Dedicated low-latency local sidetone path that bypasses the
  protocol-level monitor for keying feedback that doesn't fight
  network jitter.  Works for paddle, straight key, and CWX
  generated transmissions.  Pitch and gain follow the existing
  `pitch` / `mon_gain_cw` controls.

**Two-Tone Tune shortcut (#1995, jensenpat)**
- New unassigned `Two-Tone Tune` keyboard action under the TX
  shortcut category.  Sends `transmit set tune_mode=two_tone`
  before starting Tune, toggles off on a second press, and
  restores `tune_mode=single_tone` on stop so the regular TUNE
  press isn't surprised by sticky two-tone state.

**XVTR diagnostic logging (#1964)**
- New `xvtr` logging category captures status messages, RF↔IF
  frequency translation, and pan-bandwidth conversions so XVTR
  setup issues can be diagnosed from log bundles instead of pcap.

**XVTR policy regression tests (#1960)**
- Test harness covers transverter active/inactive state, RF↔IF
  conversion, and the family of pan-recenter cases that used to
  drop the waterfall when crossing IF/RF boundaries.

### Bug fixes

**Flex compression meter derivation across radio families (#1992, jensenpat)**
- FLEX-8000 series exposes `TX/AFTEREQ` at 20 fps as the post-EQ
  reference for compression display; FLEX-6000 captures don't
  expose `AFTEREQ`, so the best matching reference is `TX/SC_MIC`
  at 10 fps with `TX/COMPPEAK` still at 20 fps.  Mixed cadence is
  guarded by a freshness check so a fresh `COMPPEAK` isn't compared
  against a stale `SC_MIC` sample.  When `AFTEREQ` is present it
  takes precedence over `SC_MIC`.

**Preserve rtty_mark_default when radio resets mark on band change (#1968, chibondking)**
- The radio resets `slice rtty_mark` to 2125 in the status broadcast
  that follows a band change, regardless of the configured
  `rtty_mark_default`.  `SliceModel::applyStatus()` was accepting
  the 2125 value blindly, overwriting the user's configured mark.
  Now tracks `m_rttyMarkDefault` (seeded from `RadioModel`) and a
  user-override flag so the correct default is pushed back when
  the radio resets, without fighting an intentional 2125 selection.

**Fix choppy/harsh RADE decoded audio: dedicated buffer + sample-wise mix (#1953, NF0T)**
- RADE decoded audio was sharing the SSB output buffer, producing
  glitches and harsh artefacts on decoded voice.  Split into a
  dedicated buffer with per-sample mixing into the speaker output
  so RADE and SSB don't fight for the same write window.

**Fix CoreMIDI init crash during MIDI auto-connect (#1949, jensenpat)**
- macOS CoreMIDI initialisation could crash on launch when
  auto-connect ran before the MIDI client was fully constructed.
  Init order tightened so the client is ready before any
  auto-connect attempt.

**Restore shortcuts after slider nudges (#1952, jensenpat)**
- Shortcut bindings could go stale after the user nudged a slider
  with the keyboard, because focus stayed on the slider and ate
  subsequent shortcut keystrokes.  Focus now returns to the main
  window after a slider nudge.

**Preserve MIDI bindings when saving device settings (#1951, jensenpat)**
- Saving MIDI device settings was overwriting bindings with an
  empty map because the save path read from the wrong source.
  Now the existing binding map is merged into the saved settings.

**Cancel frequency entry with Escape (#1954, jensenpat)**
- The numeric frequency-entry buffer didn't honour Escape, so a
  user who started typing a frequency had to clear the buffer
  manually.  Escape now cancels the entry cleanly.

**Gate XVTR waterfall tile shifts (#1925, jensenpat)**
- Waterfall tile-shift logic continued to fire on XVTR pans even
  when the IF↔RF frequency relationship made the shift meaningless,
  producing visual tearing.  Shifts are now gated on transverter
  state.

**Close all floating windows when main window closes (#1920, chibondking)**
- Floating applet pop-outs and panadapter pop-outs were left as
  orphaned top-level windows when the main window was closed,
  forcing the user to close each one individually.  All
  floating children now close together with the main window.

### Build and CI

**cmake: declare Qt 6.2 minimum (#1962)**
- `startSystemMove` is gated behind Qt 6.2; the build now declares
  the minimum explicitly so older systems get a clean configure
  error rather than a confusing link failure.  Matches Ubuntu
  22.04 LTS shipped Qt.

**ci(windows): switch to Ninja so sccache actually wraps cl.exe (#1963)**
- The Windows CI job was using MSBuild, which sccache can't wrap
  for compilation caching.  Moved to Ninja so the sccache layer
  established in #1913 actually has effect, cutting Windows build
  times further.

**ci: speed up Windows build with sccache + Qt/FFTW caching (#1913)**
- Adds sccache for compiler caching plus GitHub Actions cache
  layers for Qt and FFTW dependencies.  First-run pulls populate
  the cache; subsequent CI runs reuse compiled objects and prebuilt
  third-party artefacts.

**Add /bigobj to MSVC compile options (#1910 → #1911)**
- The compilation unit hit the C1128 section count limit on
  MSVC.  `/bigobj` raises the limit so the unit compiles cleanly
  without splitting the file.

### Dependencies

- Bump `mozilla-actions/sccache-action` from 0.0.6 to 0.0.10 (#1941)
- Bump `actions/cache` from 4 to 5 (#1942)

## [v0.8.22] — 2026-04-25

### Connection visibility plus community polish

A connection-focused point release: new login/disconnect notifications
for remote clients, passive spots mode, find-search in help, plus a
stack of community-reported regression fixes (TCI WSJT-X TX, RADE
silent SSB, spectrum-click edge jumps, MultiFlex PTT).

### Features

**Band-stack auto-save on dwell**
- New "Auto-save dwell" setting in the band-stack ⚙ menu (Off / 10 s
  / 30 s / 60 s, default Off).  When enabled, the active slice is
  automatically added to the band stack after dwelling on a frequency
  for the configured time.  Skips entries within ±100 Hz of an
  existing bookmark (so you don't re-stack the same station), skips
  during transmit, and waits 5 s after connect before the first
  auto-save.  Caps auto-saved entries at **5 per ham band** —
  overflow drops the oldest auto-saved entry in that band, but
  manually-added bookmarks are never displaced.  Pairs naturally
  with the existing Auto-expiry option for a self-pruning rolling
  history.

**LAN and SmartLink client login notifications (#1892, jensenpat)**
- New connection-event notifications when remote LAN, SmartLink, and
  Maestro clients log in to the radio.  Surfaced as toast-style
  banners in the status bar so operators see Multi-Flex / shared-radio
  activity without watching the log.

**Remote client disconnect flows (#1889, jensenpat)**
- Disconnect remote LAN, SmartLink, and Maestro clients from inside
  AetherSDR.  Operator confirmation prompt + clean protocol teardown
  so the disconnected client sees a graceful exit rather than a stale
  session.

**Passive Spots mode (#1897, jensenpat)**
- New spots mode that ingests spot data without sending any commands
  to the radio — useful for read-only / observer scenarios where you
  want spot decorations on the spectrum but don't want the spot
  source to influence radio state.

**Device details in Slice Troubleshooter (#1898, jensenpat)**
- Slice Troubleshooter now reports audio and control device details
  alongside the existing slice diagnostics so support bundle reviewers
  can see the full I/O path from radio to host without a separate
  step.  Device-ID values are SHA-256 fingerprinted for privacy.

**Find search in help dialogs (#1899, jensenpat)**
- Help dialogs gain Ctrl+F find with case-insensitive search, F3 for
  Find Next, and Shift+F3 for Find Previous — the same shortcut
  behaviour users expect from any text viewer.

### Bug fixes

**Click-to-tune no longer recentres for clicks inside the visible spectrum (#1906, #1907)**
- Click-to-tune was triggering a comfort-margin pan recenter even
  when the click landed well inside the visible spectrum, making
  the outer 18% of each pan effectively a dead zone that auto-pulled
  the slice inward.  Two layers of fix: the spectrum-click path
  itself uses a 5% margin, *and* the `RevealOffscreen` intent that
  fires from the deferred active-slice change after a click now only
  reveals when the slice is truly outside the visible window (margin
  0).  Net behaviour matches SmartSDR — click anywhere visible and
  the panadapter stays put.

**TCI tx_enable echoes immediately to unblock WSJT-X v3.0.0 TX (#1689, #1691)**
- WSJT-X v3.0.0 waits for a `tx_enable` ack before keying.  AetherSDR's
  TCI handler now matches the `cmdTrx` pattern (immediate echo plus
  pending notification) so WSJT-X TX is unblocked on current builds.

**Fix silent audio in SSB/Digital modes when m_radeMode is active (#1875, #1879, NF0T)**
- RADE-mode activation toggled a DAX route flag in `AudioEngine` that
  left SSB and Digital modes silent on TX.  Audio path is now
  restored when RADE mode is not active.

**MultiFlex PTT label, row-selection, and correct PTT command (#1893, chibondking)**
- Three related Multi-Flex PTT issues: the PTT button label showed
  the wrong station (other client's name instead of ours), row
  selection had no effect, and the wrong protocol command was being
  sent.  `client set enforce_local_ptt=1` returns `0x50001000` on
  v1.4.0.0 — the correct command is `client set local_ptt=1`, which
  is now used and documented in `CLAUDE.md` quirks.

**Network health indicator stabilised for SmartLink and remote paths (#1900, jensenpat)**
- Status-bar network indicator was twitchy on LTE, SmartLink, and
  hotel Wi-Fi.  Now uses remote-friendly RTT thresholds, evaluates
  VITA packet loss over a rolling 10-second window, includes audio
  inter-arrival jitter, and adds display hysteresis so the label
  only changes state when the underlying condition is sustained.
  Tooltip and diagnostics dialog now also show recent packet loss
  and network jitter.

**Suppress startup client login replays (#1904, jensenpat)**
- When AetherSDR subscribed to `client all` after connecting, the
  radio replayed the current client list as `client ... connected`
  status messages — which the new notification handler from #1892
  treated as fresh logins.  Existing client handles captured from
  discovery and the SmartLink radio list are now treated as already
  present, with a 5-second startup grace window as a fallback.

**Persist CAT/TCI/DAX IQ enabled state across restarts (#1890, chibondking)**
- CAT, TCI, and DAX IQ enabled flags weren't written to AppSettings,
  so toggling any of them off and restarting brought them back on.
  Now persisted under their respective enabled keys and restored at
  startup.

**Reduce minimum window height (#1793, #1798)**
- Operators with smaller vertical footprints (low-resolution
  displays, cramped multi-monitor setups) couldn't shrink the main
  window below the prior height floor.  Lowered the minimum so
  small layouts fit.

**What's New release date now visible (#1783, #1785)**
- The release date line on the What's New dialog was being clipped
  off the visible area.  Layout now anchors the date inside the
  dialog frame.

**Restore Flex band-stack selection keys (#1887, jensenpat)**
- The hardware Flex front-panel band-stack keys had stopped routing
  to the band-stack selection action after a recent refactor.
  Re-wired so keypad band selection works again.

**Tighten incremental pan-follow margins**
- Trigger margin lowered from 12% → 5% and settle from 18% → 6% so
  trackpad / wheel / arrow-key tuning at the pan edge feels snappier
  without losing the smooth follow animation.

**Shorten client-connection status message from 10s to 3s**
- The transient banner shown after a successful connection was
  staying up too long and obscuring slice activity.

**Fix versioning label issue on Windows**
- Build version label on Windows could render incorrectly when the
  build metadata included certain characters.  Resolved.

**Band-stack ⚙ / × / + buttons no longer clip their glyphs**
- The three control buttons in the band-stack bottom row now have
  zero internal padding so the multiplication-sign, plus, and gear
  glyphs render fully inside the small fixed-size buttons regardless
  of font/DPI.

## [v0.8.21] — 2026-04-23

### Recenter policy unification plus Band Stack management

Another community-heavy point release.  Five community PRs plus six
AetherClaude fixes address crash + UX regressions uncovered in v0.8.20,
a Wayland+FFmpeg crash class, a RADE TX regression from v0.8.19, and
a large tuning-policy refactor that consolidates pan/zoom/reveal
decisions into one shared intent model.  Plus the first Band Stack
management feature (clear all, band grouping, auto-expiry).

### Features

**Unified tuning/recenter policy (#1861, jensenpat)**
- Large refactor (+1038/-207, new `RECENTER.md` design doc) that
  moves pan-follow, reveal, and hard-center decisions out of individual
  call sites and into a shared `MainWindow` policy layer.  Every tuning
  input path (VFO wheel, spectrum wheel, trackpad, keys, MIDI,
  FlexControl, HID, memory, spots, clicks, band stack) now dispatches
  through a small `TuneIntent` enum: `IncrementalTune`, `AbsoluteJump`,
  `CommandedTargetCenter`, `ExplicitPan`, `RevealOffscreen`.
- Incremental tuning now uses step-quantized follow (12 % trigger
  edge, 18 % settle, 110 ms animation) so trackpad / wheel / keys
  at the pan edge nudge smoothly instead of page-flipping.
- Combined pan/zoom operations now send one coherent
  `display pan set center=X bandwidth=Y` command instead of two
  separate commands — fixes the P1 waterfall-loss / edge-drop bug
  seen during bandwidth drag and trackpad zoom.
- Fixes the P2 keyboard zoom +/- drift seen after memory recall and
  mode jumps (USB ↔ SAM).
- Memory spot clicks no longer go through an intermediate generic
  spot path — memory recall owns the tune+center ordering end-to-end.
- See `RECENTER.md` for the full architecture, intent semantics,
  call-site classification, and intentional exception list (band
  shortcuts, `restoreBandState`, RxApplet direct entry, and CAT/TCI
  external-control paths still use `tuneAndRecenter`).

**Band Stack management (#1471 → #1472)**
- New UI affordances in the Band Stack sidebar:
  - **× button** — "Clear All" with a confirmation dialog, so
    accidental clears during contests don't wipe a day's work.
  - **⚙ button** — opens a settings menu for "Group by band" and
    auto-expiry (Off / 5 / 15 / 30 / 60 min).
- Grouped mode uses the existing band-definition table; each band
  section gets a header label and a right-click "Clear band" action.
- Auto-expiry defaults off.  Enabled expiry uses a 30-second timer
  that starts on radio connect and stops on disconnect, and
  stale-entry pruning also runs on startup so entries saved under
  an expiry threshold are cleaned when the app reopens.
- Backwards-compatible XML schema: pre-existing entries carry a
  `CreatedAtMs = 0` sentinel and are never auto-expired.
- Thanks to LU5DX for the feature request and LU5FF for the idea.

### Bug fixes

**Install tolerant X11 error handler (#1840)**
- Qt Multimedia's FFmpeg backend probes VA-API / VDPAU hardware
  accel via X11 even under native Wayland.  On systems that ship
  `libvdpau-va-gl` by default (openSUSE Tumbleweed + Packman is the
  canonical case, Fedora RPMfusion is adjacent), VDPAU calls into
  X11/GLX under Wayland → `BadAccess` → Xlib default handler calls
  `exit()` → AetherSDR crashes on Audio-tab open.
- Install a tolerant X11 error handler (via `dlopen(libX11.so.6)` +
  `XSetErrorHandler`) that logs the error and returns 0 instead of
  aborting.  Linux-only, no build-time X11 dependency.
- `AetherX11ErrorEvent` struct layout corrected to match XErrorEvent
  field order so the diagnostic log reports accurate error codes.

**DXCC prefix resolution off GUI thread (#1844)**
- 0.8.19 regression surfaced at 125 k-QSO log sizes: when the ADIF
  auto-reloader (new in 0.8.19) re-processed the logbook,
  `onParseFinished` did O(N) DXCC prefix lookups on the GUI thread,
  producing 0.5 – 1 s waterfall freezes.
- Move prefix resolution into the existing ADIF parse worker thread
  via an optional `AdifParser::setCtyParser()`.  `CtyDatParser` is
  demonstrably read-only after `loadCtyDat()`, so cross-thread access
  is safe.  GUI thread only does the cheap `m_workedStatus.load()`
  hash inserts on the queued callback.

**TCI RX meter post-gain (#1716 → #1717)**
- TCI RX level meter and DAX RX level meter in the same applet panel
  used different measurement points: TCI was pre-gain, DAX was
  post-gain.  At default gain 0.5 that made TCI read ~6 dB higher
  than DAX for the same signal.
- Maintainer decision (community RFC by NF0T): move TCI to post-gain
  to match DAX convention, SmartSDR convention, and make fader
  movement immediately visible on the meter.

**XVTR waterfall always black (#1845)**
- When a transverter is active the radio reports pan center in RF
  domain (e.g. 144.2 MHz) but the VITA-49 waterfall tile header
  carries IF-domain frequencies (e.g. ~28 MHz).  The existing
  frequency-accurate bin mapping then produced bin indices outside
  `srcSize` for every pixel and the scanline stayed all-black.
- Detect the tile/pan frequency mismatch in
  `MainWindow::waterfallRowReady` and shift the tile's reported
  low/high by `panCenter - tileCenter` so the existing
  frequency-accurate rendering in `SpectrumWidget` aligns with the
  pan.  HF panadapters are unaffected (their tiles always overlap,
  the shift branch never fires).

**PAN freeze in Minimal Mode with popped-out panadapter (#1748)**
- `toggleMinimalMode(true)` called `setUpdatesEnabled(false)` on
  every applet in `m_panStack->allApplets()`, which includes
  floating (popped-out) pans.  Their content froze even though
  their window was still visible.
- Skip floating pans on the suspend path via
  `PanadapterStack::isFloating()`.  CPU savings for normal
  (no-pop-out) minimal-mode use are preserved unchanged.

**rigctld TCP CAT per-port slice binding (#1621 → #1623)**
- WSJT-X sends `V VFOB` on init, which `cmdSetVfo()` was treating
  as an authoritative slice-index override.  Every WSJT-X instance
  across multiple rigctld ports then ended up controlling Slice B.
- `cmdSetVfo()` now accepts the command without changing
  `m_sliceIndex` (which is set per-connection by the TCP port
  binding in `RigctlServer::onNewConnection`).  `cmdGetVfo()`
  always reports VFOA (the current VFO for this connection) and
  `cmdGetSplitVfo()` decouples the client-visible VFO label from
  the internal slice id.
- Follow-up #1868 filed for the separate `cmdSetSplitVfo` stub on
  the enable=true path.

**RADE TX no-waveform regression from #1780 (#1865, NF0T)**
- v0.8.19 added `emit daxRouteRequested(on ? 0 : 1)` to
  `AudioEngine::setRadeMode` on the mistaken theory that RADE
  wanted the radio's mic path.  On PTT in RADE mode this sent
  `transmit set dax=0`, which made the radio discard every
  `dax_tx` VITA-49 packet from the RADE encoder and transmit
  silence from the physical mic.
- Remove the `daxRouteRequested` signal and its wiring entirely.
  `updateDaxTxMode` already sets `dax=1` when the TX slice is in
  DIGU/DIGL (which RADE activation configures), so the correct
  routing is always in place before PTT.

**Applet pop-out persistence and app-exit regression (#1860, chibondking)**
- Four bugs around the migration from the retired
  `FloatingAppletWindow` (System A) to the new `ContainerManager`
  (System B):
  1. `ContainerGeometry_P/CW` uses `/` which is invalid in
     AppSettings XML element names → silent save/load failure for
     the P/CW applet → position lost on every restart.  Fixed by
     sanitizing `/` → `_` in `geometryKeyFor`, matching System A's
     `floatKey()` helper.
  2. Legacy float-state migration read the raw ID while System A
     wrote the sanitized key → P/CW users migrating from older
     versions saw the applet docked.  Same sanitizer applied to
     the read path.
  3. Floating windows kept the process alive after the main window
     closed, because they inherited `WA_QuitOnClose=true` as
     top-level widgets.  `WA_QuitOnClose=false` now marks them as
     secondary.
  4. `moveEvent`/`resizeEvent` wrote AppSettings on every pixel of
     a window drag (~60 Hz).  Replaced with a 400 ms debounce
     timer matching System A's original pattern.

**Arduino WiFiServer TCP deadlock for ShackSwitch R4 (#1859, nigelfenton)**
- ShackSwitch R4 is an Arduino-based Antenna Genius.  Arduino's
  `WiFiServer::available()` only returns a connected client once
  the client has sent data, but the AG protocol is
  server-speaks-first (`V1.0 AG`).  Result: AetherSDR waits for the
  greeting, R4 waits for client data → TCP deadlock → every AG
  connect silently hangs.
- Detect ShackSwitch devices (`name.contains("ShackSwitch")`) and send
  an empty `\r\n` on TCP connect.  R4 firmware discards empty lines
  before the greeting, protocol proceeds normally.  Real 4O3A Antenna
  Genius devices do not match the check — zero impact on existing AG
  behaviour.
- Also fix a reconnect-race by replacing the `if (m_connected)` guard
  with an unconditional socket abort in `connectToDevice`, plus
  add an `isConnecting()` helper for UI state.
- Contributed by Nigel Fenton (G0JKN) — the author of the ShackSwitch
  device itself.

## [v0.8.20] — 2026-04-22

### Community regression round-up + crash batch

Eight community contributions plus three AetherClaude crash fixes.
The community batch covers real-world regressions found on Windows,
macOS and Linux: RADE RX on Windows, macOS FT8 DT bias, TCI DAX
crosstalk, RX applet pan-with-NR, gain defaults, a Windows build
break, a Canadian band plan refresh, and seamless ADIF logbook
auto-reload.  Three crash fixes address applet reorder, Wayland
Radio Setup dialog, and popped-out panadapter freeze.

### Bug fixes

**Fix RADE RX not decoding on Windows (#1820, NF0T)**
- On platforms without a DAX audio bridge (Windows, Linux without
  PipeWire), `startDax()` is compiled out so `stream create dax_rx`
  is never sent.  RADE mode showed "activated" but produced no
  decoded audio because `feedRxAudio()` never got called.
- `activateRADE()` now creates the `dax_rx` stream directly on
  non-bridge platforms and registers its stream ID with
  PanadapterStream.  TCI borrow-safe cleanup on deactivate — won't
  tear down a stream another client is reading.
- Verified end-to-end on Windows 11 + FLEX-8400.

**Clamp stale DAX RX backlog on macOS (#1822, jensenpat)**
- FT8 decodes in WSJT-X / JTDX showed a consistent +1.5 s to +1.6 s
  `DT` offset on macOS even with healthy LAN latency — severe enough
  to cause missed QSOs.
- Root cause: macOS `VirtualAudioBridge` writes DAX RX audio into a
  POSIX shared-memory ring large enough for ~2 s of audio.  The TX
  path had live-edge backlog protection; the RX path did not.  If
  the CoreAudio reader fell behind the ring accumulated stale audio
  and served it as if current.
- New live-edge clamp advances the reader when backlog exceeds
  ~200 ms, keeping a ~40 ms target.  Per-channel timing counters
  behind the existing `aether.dax` debug category.  Scoped to macOS
  only — Linux uses `O_NONBLOCK` named pipes (drops at syscall),
  Windows has no in-process buffer.

**Fix TCI DAX audio crosstalk between slices (#1815, Chaosuk97)**
- Two simultaneous DAX channels (dual-band WSJT-X, satellite
  full-duplex RX) caused audio from slice A to bleed into slice B.
- Root cause: `r8brain CDSPResampler` is stateful.  `ClientState`
  held a single shared resampler reused across channels, so filter
  state from channel 1 carried over into channel 2.  The
  accumulation buffer was already per-channel; the resampler wasn't.
- Replaced the shared `Resampler*` with
  `QHash<int, Resampler*> resamplers` keyed by DAX channel.  Lazy
  per-channel creation, `qDeleteAll()` on rate change / disconnect.

**Fix RX applet pan slider broken with NR active (#1799, Chaosuk97)**
- PR #1460 re-applied pan after client NR mono-mix but only tracked
  pan changes from the VFO panel slider.  The RX applet, MIDI, and
  keyboard shortcuts call `SliceModel::setAudioPan()` directly —
  `AudioEngine::m_rxPan` stayed at 50, making the RX applet pan
  slider a no-op when NR was active.
- Listen to `SliceModel::audioPanChanged` instead — one connection
  now covers VFO panel, RX applet, MIDI, and radio echo-back on
  connect.

**Fix TCI RX gain default fallback: 1.0 → 0.5 (#1811, NF0T)**
- `TciServer` fallback for a missing `TciRxGain<n>` key was "1.0"
  while `TciApplet` used "0.5".  Fresh install or post-migration
  without the key ran the server at full gain while the slider
  showed half — TCI RX audio 2× louder than DAX at equal positions.

**Fix missing HAVE_SERIALPORT guard on m_flexCoalesceTimer (#1812, NF0T)**
- PR #1606 guarded `m_hidCoalesceTimer` behind `HAVE_HIDAPI` but
  left `m_flexCoalesceTimer` unguarded on the line above — broke
  Windows builds without `Qt6::SerialPort`.  Wrapped the reference
  in `HAVE_SERIALPORT` to match the member declaration.

**Seamless ADIF logbook auto-reload for DXCC spot colouring (#1801, Chaosuk97)**
- Spot colours only updated when the user manually clicked Browse
  and re-selected the log file.  The "Auto-Reload Log" toggle
  defaulted off and broke in edge cases: atomic rename (N1MM,
  Log4OM), Windows write-lock during export, delete-then-recreate.
- Toggle removed — Browse now always arms the watcher.  2-second
  debounce coalesces rapid change notifications; watcher re-arms
  after debounce so atomic rename (new inode) is caught.  Directory
  watcher on the parent folder catches delete-then-recreate.  Open
  retries 3× at 500 ms intervals for write-locks.  Worked status
  preserved on open failure — colours don't flash empty during
  export.  "Updating…" shown during async parse.

**Fix crash when reordering applets with floating containers (#1745 → #1746)**
- Dragging an applet title bar to reorder crashed AetherSDR when
  any other applet was popped out into a floating window.
- Root cause: `QWidget::mapTo()` traverses the parent chain looking
  for a common ancestor.  When a container is floating (reparented
  to `FloatingContainerWindow` — a separate top-level window), there
  is no common ancestor with the scroll area's content widget and
  `mapTo()` dereferences `nullptr`.
- `dragMoveEvent()`, `dropIndexFromY()` and `rebuildStackOrder()`
  now skip entries whose `ContainerWidget::isFloating()` is true.
  Follow-up filed as #1836 for the separate TXDSP ID-mismatch that
  makes that container silently un-reorderable.

**Lazy-build RadioSetupDialog tabs (#1776 → #1777)**
- Opening Settings → Radio Setup / FlexControl / USB Cables crashed
  on some Wayland / Qt 6.11 configurations (openSUSE Tumbleweed with
  Packman non-free FFmpeg 8.1).  Real crash cause is
  `libvdpau_va_gl` trying to create a VDPAU device via X11/GLX on a
  native Wayland session — an upstream Qt Multimedia backend /
  distro packaging problem, not an AetherSDR bug.
- Converted the dialog from eager to lazy tab construction — only
  the Radio tab builds on open; the other ten tabs get placeholder
  widgets and deferred builders triggered on first tab-switch.
  Dialog opens without crashing (and faster on every platform).
  Users on the affected config will still hit the VDPAU crash if
  they click the Audio tab; the real fix is to switch
  `QT_MEDIA_BACKEND=gstreamer` or use stock Mesa FFmpeg.

**Fix UI freeze when PanAdapter is popped out (#1668 → #1669)**
- Content inside a popped-out panadapter froze — waterfall stopped
  scrolling, spectrum stopped updating — while the main window
  remained fully responsive.  Re-docking restored normal operation.
- Two problems in `PanadapterStack::floatPanadapter()`: the
  SpectrumWidget was shown immediately after reparenting, before
  `refreshAfterReparent()` rebound the Metal render target to the
  new NSView, so the first frame rendered on a stale/transitional
  surface.  And the reparent went through `setParent(nullptr)` —
  on macOS with `WA_NativeWindow`, that creates a transient
  top-level NSWindow before the floating window adopts it, a second
  lesser problem addressed by #1344 for the dock path but never the
  float path.
- New `PanFloatingWindow::adoptApplet()` method reparents directly
  via `m_layout->addWidget()` — single splitter→floating-window
  step, no nullptr intermediate.  `sw->show()` moved into the
  deferred callback after `refreshAfterReparent()` so Metal binds
  to the final NSView before the first render.

**Minor Canadian band-plan corrections (#1817, VE3NEM)**
- RAC band plan updates from a Canadian ham: label corrections on
  overlapping CW/DIG segments (1.800, 7.035), WSPR 80 m frequency
  corrected (3.5926 → 3.5686 MHz), obsolete CW calling frequencies
  removed and standard international QRP calling frequencies added
  (14.060, 21.060, 28.060, etc.), missing SSB calling frequencies
  added on 17 m / 15 m / 12 m / 10 m / 1.25 m.

## [v0.8.19] — 2026-04-20

### Community contributions landfest + macOS MNR + quick memory actions

This release is mostly community work.  Ten community PRs landed, plus an
AetherClaude-draft fix batch covering bandwidth-correction echoes, stale
slice-click tuning, Windows rigctld IPv4, serial port persistence, DX
cluster reconnect, compression-meter gain reduction, and macOS audio
device override.

### Features

**macOS MMSE-Wiener spectral noise reduction (MNR) (#1672, Chaosuk97)**
- New macOS-exclusive client-side NR mode accelerated via Apple
  Accelerate (vDSP / AMX on Apple Silicon).  Decision-directed
  MMSE-Wiener filter with 25-frame minimum-statistics noise-floor
  tracking.  512-point real FFT at 24 kHz, 50% overlap-add with
  sqrt-Hann window, per-bin gain with temporal smoothing to suppress
  musical noise.  ~0.3 ms per hop on M-series chips, one-hop startup
  latency (≈10.7 ms).
- MNR button appears in both the VFO DSP tab and the spectrum overlay
  DSP panel.  DSP Settings dialog gains a new MNR tab with a strength
  slider (0-100).  Mutually exclusive with NR2/RN2/NR4/BNR/DFNR.
  Persists enable state + strength across restart.
- Non-Apple builds: `#ifdef __APPLE__` gated throughout — zero MNR
  overhead, buttons hidden.

**PooDoo™ TX Reverb (#1741) — carried forward, chain now complete**
- Already shipped in v0.8.18 final release notes; listed here for
  completeness since it rolls into the 0.8.19 post-release chain view.

**Quick memory browse + save on slice overlays (#1781, jensenpat)**
- Two new actions in the slice overlay rail between Display and DAX:
  - **MEM▸** opens a compact 252×430 browser drawer, frequency-sorted,
    pre-scrolled to the active slice's nearest memory.  Click-to-recall.
  - **MEM+** opens a small save dialog for the current slice on that
    panadapter.  Captures mode, filter, step, repeater offset, tone,
    squelch, RTTY/DIGL offsets — same field set as the main Memory
    dialog via the new shared `MemoryCommands` helper module.
- Pan-aware routing: save/recall targets the active slice if it lives
  on this pan, otherwise the first slice found on the pan.  The MEM
  buttons now show the target slice letter (e.g. `MEM▸ A`) so users
  can see which slice will be hit before clicking — makes the
  multi-slice fallback visible.

**Improved TNF notch interaction (#1547, rfoust)**
- TNF markers no longer extend into the waterfall — they stop at the
  bottom of the spectrum pane so the waterfall stays a historical
  signal record.
- Depth visualisation via hatching (12/8/5 px spacing for depth 1/2/3).
- Floating "RF Tracking Notch" popup on hover shows frequency + width.
- Width/depth submenu items show a checkmark on the currently-active
  value.
- Bidirectional TNF drag: horizontal tunes, vertical resizes via
  `2^(-dy/48)` octaves, clamped 10-12 000 Hz.
- Preferred-TNF hit-testing for overlapping notches — dragging a TNF
  preserves the target across its sibling's overlap zone.
- Tune guides suppressed while a TNF is hovered or dragged.
- `TnfModel`: optimistic local updates in setters so UI responds
  without waiting for radio echo; width parser tolerates both Hz
  ("width=100") and fractional-MHz forms for firmware-version variance.

**RAC Canada Band Plan corrected + expanded (#1709, VE3NEM)**
- VHF / UHF bands added (6 m, 2 m, 1.25 m, 70 cm) — prior file was
  HF-only, so 4 new ham-band coverage tiers arrive in this update.
- 60 m channels updated to match the Feb 2026 ISED regulation change
  (new 5.3570-5.3598 channel).
- 12 m frequencies corrected.
- FT8 spot at 14.074 added back, one duplicate spot removed.

**Frameless Window toggle (View menu, Ctrl+Shift+F)**
- View → Frameless Window applies Qt's `FramelessWindowHint` so users
  gain ~32 px of vertical screen space at the cost of the OS title bar.
  Works cross-platform (X11, Wayland, Windows, macOS) — KDE window
  rules don't strip Qt's client-side decorations reliably on Wayland,
  so we drop the frame in code.  Move/close via WM shortcuts or
  taskbar.  Persists across restart; applied before first `show()` so
  there's no flash-of-chrome on startup.

**CHAIN-driven TX DSP (v0.8.18 rebase — carried forward)**
- Already in v0.8.18 release notes; called out here because subsequent
  releases continue to build on the CHAIN ordering.

### Bug fixes

**NR2 crackling on strong signals (#1696, Chaosuk97)**
- Cap `gainMax` default 1.5 → 1.0.  The MMSE-LSA estimator is a noise
  *reducer* — the old 1.5 default allowed 50% amplification on strong
  signals, which pushed output past ±1.0 float32 full scale and caused
  QAudioSink digital-clipping crackle.
- Belt-and-suspenders `std::clamp(sample, -1.0f, 1.0f)` in
  `processNr2()`.  A separate Bessel overflow (issue #1507) can still
  produce NaN-burst crackle on Gamma-method NR2 under strong-signal
  conditions — tracked for follow-up, not in this release.

**Audio pan broken with client NR active (#1685, Chaosuk97) + per-slice AF mute persistence (#1560)**
- Client-side NR (NR2 / RN2 / NR4 / DFNR) mono-mixes L+R before
  processing, destroying the radio-applied pan.  New
  `AudioEngine::setRxPan` atomic + static `applyRxPanInPlace` helper
  re-applies a linear pan law to the NR output so the pan slider
  continues to work while client NR is active.  No-op at pan 50
  (centre) — zero overhead when user hasn't panned.
- Per-slice AF mute now persists across sessions.  VFO widget emits
  `audioMuteToggled`; MainWindow saves `SliceAudioMuted_{A,B,C,D}` to
  AppSettings on every user toggle, restores on reconnect.  Uses the
  slice letter (not numeric id) for the settings key so state survives
  sessions where the radio assigns a different numeric id.

**VFO / TNF / filter-edge ±1 px jitter during tuning (#1703, Chaosuk97) + cursor-snap-to-VFO (#1369)**
- `mhzToX()` switched from integer truncation to `std::round` so the
  same frequency always maps to the same pixel column regardless of
  pan-center fractional drift during continuous tune.  One-line fix
  that ripples through every vertical marker — VFO, TNF, filter edges,
  RIT/XIT, band plan, spots, grid.
- Cursor frequency readout snaps to the exact VFO frequency when
  within 8 px of a slice marker (GPU path already had this; software
  `paintEvent` path added for symmetry).
- `setSliceOverlayFreq()` now calls `markOverlayDirty()` and
  early-exits on unchanged value.

**Zoom +/- can't reach full panadapter bandwidth (#1697, Chaosuk97)**
- Replace early-return guard in `emitZoom` / keyboard zoom with
  `std::clamp(newBw, minBwMhz, maxBwMhz)` so the final click/keypress
  snaps to exactly the radio's min/max — matching the mouse-drag
  behaviour which already used clamp.

**PC Audio button shows wrong state on connect (#1695, Chaosuk97)**
- `onConnectionStateChanged` now reads `PcAudioEnabled` once and calls
  both `m_titleBar->setPcAudioEnabled(...)` (sync button, with
  QSignalBlocker) and `audioStartRx()` from the same decision.
  Previously the sink and button could diverge after a profile import.

**Waterfall filter-passband fill removed (#1701, Chaosuk97)**
- The coloured filter-passband fill in the waterfall was only rendered
  by the software-fallback paintEvent path — the GPU renderer already
  skipped it.  Dropping the software `fillRect` brings the two render
  paths into agreement.  Filter edge lines still render in both panes.

**TCI DAX duplicate stream causing 2× audio speed (#1679 / #1678)**
- Two code paths both subscribing to `dax_rx` for the same channel
  made `daxAudioReady` fire twice per period, doubling WSJT-X's
  apparent sample rate and killing FT8 decode.  Registration now
  evicts stale subscribers and TCI uses a borrow protocol.

**TCI TX no RF output (#1680)**
- Always emit `transmit set dax=1` on PTT regardless of the previous
  Low-Latency DAX menu toggle.  The `dax=0` path was advertised for
  external FreeDV over virtual audio cable but never actually worked
  because that route silently drops `dax_tx` VITA-49 packets.  The
  Low-Latency DAX menu has since been retired (#1780).

**Low-Latency DAX consolidated into RADE mode (#1780)**
- The "Low-Latency DAX (FreeDV)" menu item was removed.  RADE mode's
  activation now emits a `daxRouteRequested` signal that MainWindow
  routes to `transmit set dax=N`, flipping the route atomically with
  the RADE button.  One control, one place.  Stale
  `DaxTxLowLatency` AppSettings value is no longer read.

**Bandwidth corrections silently dropped during pan-follow (#1729)**
- The stale-echo guard in `setFrequencyRange` bypassed *any* echo
  during an in-flight pan-center animation when the center matched.
  If the echo also carried a bandwidth correction (e.g. post-resize
  `xpixels` re-sync), it was thrown away.  Guard now also checks the
  bandwidth field so legitimate corrections pass through.

**Pan-follow VFO edge-tracking after manual drag (#1643)**
- After a manual spectrum drag, `PanadapterModel::centerMhz` lagged
  the visible pan center by up to one frame.  `panFollowVfo` now
  reads the live center from the spectrum widget instead of the
  model, so edge-fence checks fire against the user's actual view.

**Propagation overlay click tunes VFO by accident (#1647)**
- Clicking the K/SFI propagation overlay was also triggering the
  release-to-tune path.  Set `m_spotClickConsumed = true` after the
  `propForecastClicked` emission so the subsequent release event
  can short-circuit.

**Off-screen slice click tunes wrong frequency (#1772)**
- Same pattern as the prop-overlay fix: clicking an off-screen slice
  indicator now suppresses release-to-tune so the tuning action
  doesn't pile on top of the slice-activate.

**rigctld TCP server not accepting IPv4 on Windows (#1737)**
- `QHostAddress::Any` sometimes binds IPv6-only on Windows, leaving
  IPv4 clients unable to connect.  Use `QHostAddress::AnyIPv4`
  explicitly.

**Serial port parameters (data bits, parity, stop bits) not persisted (#1610)**
- RadioSetupDialog's serial tab built the combos with defaults but
  never read from AppSettings or connected the save handler.  Added
  both.

**Compression meter shows raw dBFS instead of gain reduction (#1682)**
- COMPPEAK is the compressor *output* level; AFTEREQ is the *input*.
  Meter was displaying raw COMPPEAK, which just shows "how loud is
  the output" instead of "how much is the compressor reducing".  Now
  shows `output - input` (gain reduction, 0 = no reduction, negative
  = compressing).

**macOS audio output device silently overridden (#1705)**
- On macOS, AudioEngine replaced the user's chosen output device with
  `QMediaDevices::defaultAudioOutput()` whenever Qt reported 48 kHz
  as unsupported — but that happens on some normal CoreAudio outputs
  with newer Qt, not just Bluetooth telephony routes.  Narrow the
  override to devices that genuinely can't handle the native 24 kHz
  format.

### Internal

**Issue template tightened**
- Bug-report reproduction steps are now required.  AetherSDR version,
  radio model+firmware, and OS are required fields with platform-
  specific guidance (Linux distro + Qt / macOS version + chip /
  Windows edition).  Improves triage quality on incoming reports.

**Contributors**
- Added VE3NEM, Ian M7HNF (Chaosuk97), and jensenpat to the About
  dialog contributors list.

### Reverted

- The spectrum/waterfall alignment tweak from #1694 was landed as a
  partial fix (alignment math only, skipping an unrelated
  SMOOTH_ALPHA tuning change) then reverted when the trimmed fix
  introduced misalignment rather than correcting it.  Issue #1690
  closed — the originally-reported bug did not reproduce on main.

## [v0.8.18] — 2026-04-20

### PooDoo™ TX Audio — complete six-stage DSP chain, click-bypass, reverb

### Features

**PooDoo™ Audio: Gate, DeEss, Tube, PUDU DSPs + editors (#1661 phases 2-5, #1734)**
- Four new client-side TX DSP stages complete the chain started in v0.8.17:
  - **ClientGate** — downward expander / noise gate with Expander↔Gate
    mode toggle, threshold/ratio/attack/hold/release/floor/return/look-ahead
    parameters, Ableton-style level view with two-threshold hysteresis band.
  - **ClientDeEss** — sidechain-filtered de-esser.  Tunable bandpass
    (1-12 kHz log sweep, Q 0.5-5) feeds the envelope detector; threshold +
    amount parameters control broadband attenuation on sibilance.
  - **ClientTube** — dynamic tube saturator with three models (A: soft
    tanh, B: hard-clip + tanh hybrid, C: asymmetric) + bipolar envelope-
    driven drive, tilt pre-filter, parallel dry/wet mix.
  - **ClientPudu** — exciter modelled on Aphex Aural Exciter + Big Bottom
    (Even mode — asymmetric harmonics + LF saturation) and Behringer
    SX 3040 (Odd mode — symmetric tanh + feed-forward LF compressor).
    Six-knob Poo/Doo layout with glowing PooDoo™ wordmark driven by wet
    RMS level.
- Every stage has a full-featured floating editor with Ableton-style
  visualisations: level histograms, curve overlays, live envelope
  balls.  Editors run lock-free atomic parameter updates with a version
  counter so audio-thread `process()` never locks or allocates.
- Consistent visual language across all editors: uniform 76×76 knobs
  with in-ring labels that auto-shrink to fit, right-aligned Bypass
  buttons, and uniform "Thresh" / "Freq" naming conventions.
- Per-stage test harnesses in `tests/client_*_test.cpp` covering DSP
  invariants (impulse response, ratio curves, mix laws, stereo
  linkage, finite output under extreme params).

**PUDU Monitor — post-chain record + playback (#1734)**
- Two icon buttons in the CHAIN header (⏺ record, ▶ play) capture up to
  30 seconds of **post-PUDU TX audio** without transmitting.  Recording
  writes an int16 stereo 24 kHz WAV to `/tmp/pudu_monitor.wav` for
  offline inspection; playback streams from an in-memory buffer through
  the existing RX sink path.
- Record button is only enabled when MIC=PC and DAX=off — same
  condition that turns the `[MIC]` endpoint green in the CHAIN widget.
  Transitioning out of that state mid-record auto-stops.
- During recording and playback the RX panadapter stream is
  disconnected from the audio sink (same pattern as QsoRecorder) so
  live band audio doesn't bleed under the preview.

**Reverb (Freeverb) stage + CHAIN integration (#1741)**
- New **ClientReverb** DSP — Jezar's canonical Freeverb algorithm: 8
  parallel lowpass-feedback comb filters summed through 4 series
  allpass filters, stereo-spread by 23 samples between channels.
  Pre-delay ring buffer in front of the reverb core.  Sample-rate-
  scaled for 24 kHz native processing; CPU cost under 1 % of one core.
- Five-knob control set: **Size** (0-100 %), **Decay** (0.3-5 s
  exponential), **Damping** (0-100 %), **Pre-delay** (0-100 ms),
  **Mix** (0-100 %).
- Ships **disabled by default** and positioned as the final stage
  (`[MIC]→[GATE]→[EQ]→[DESS]→[COMP]→[TUBE]→[PUDU]→[VERB]→[TX]`) — reverb
  on ham TX is unusual and trades intelligibility for "bigness".  Users
  opt in by single-clicking `[VERB]` in CHAIN.
- Settings persisted as `ClientReverbTx*` in `AppSettings`.  9-case
  test harness covers impulse tail, decay monotonicity, dry/wet laws,
  pre-delay timing, mono/stereo processing.

**CHAIN gesture set — single-click bypass, double-click edit (#1739)**
- CHAIN widget rewires the click gestures:
  - **Single-click** a stage → toggle bypass.
  - **Double-click** a stage → open its floating editor.
  - **Drag** a stage → reorder the chain.
  - **Right-click** → context menu (Edit… / Bypass).
- Deferred single-click timer (at the OS double-click interval) lets a
  genuine double-click cancel the pending bypass toggle so the gestures
  don't fight.
- **Bypass buttons removed from every node editor** — bypass now lives
  exclusively on the CHAIN widget.  Enable / Edit buttons removed from
  every applet tile (GATE, CEQ, DESS, CMP, TUBE, PUDU) since the CHAIN
  is now the single source of truth.

**Applet-tile knob rows (#1739)**
- Every DSP node's applet tile grows a compact 4-5 knob tuning row at
  PUDU-style 38×48 px so common parameters can be tweaked without
  opening the full editor:
  - **GATE**: Thresh · Ratio · Attack · Release · Floor
  - **DESS**: Freq · Q · Thresh · Amount
  - **CMP**: Thresh · Ratio · Attack · Release · Makeup
  - **TUBE**: Drive · Tone · Bias · Output · Mix
  - **PUDU**: Drive · Tune · Mix | Tune · Air · Mix (Poo/Doo groups)
  - **VERB**: Size · Decay · Damp · Pre · Mix
- 30 Hz two-way sync (QSignalBlocker-guarded) keeps applet and editor
  knobs in lock-step when values change in either surface.

**Applet-stack order mirrors CHAIN order (#1739)**
- Dragging a stage to a new position in CHAIN automatically reorders
  the sub-container tiles inside the PooDoo™ Audio group to match.
  On startup the persisted chain order drives the initial tile order.
- CEQ titlebar shows "COMPRESSOR" (was "CMP"); TXDSP group button bar
  label renamed "VUDU" → "PUDU" to match the exciter node; Settings
  key stays `Applet_TXDSP` for migration.

**Visual TX signal chain applet (#1661)**
- New CHAIN tile renders the full TX DSP path as a row of labelled
  boxes — MIC → GATE → EQ → DESS → COMP → TUBE → ENH → TX — with
  live bypass state, drag-drop reordering, per-stage click-to-edit
  and right-click bypass.  Snake layout wraps to 3-3-2 rows so the
  full chain fits inside the 260 px applet panel without cramping
  box labels.
- DSP: generalised TX chain replaces the previous two-option
  CMP↔EQ toggle with a generic ordered stage list stored as a
  packed uint64_t atomic (one byte per slot).  Audio thread loads
  the whole chain in one acquire-read per block; `applyClientTxDsp`
  walks the stage list and dispatches to the matching per-stage
  apply helper.  Gate, DeEss, Tube, Enh are stub slots today —
  placeholders for Phase 2+ Pro-XL work — and users can drag them
  into their preferred position now so the layout is ready when
  their DSP ships.
- Existing ClientCompTxChainOrder (0/1) settings migrate cleanly:
  legacy CMP-first / EQ-first positions carry over into the new
  stage list with the canonical stages (Gate, DeEss, Tube, Enh)
  appended in sensible slots.

**Unified TX DSP container**
- CHAIN, CEQ and CMP are now three sections of a single TXDSP tile
  in the applet tray.  Each section has its own titlebar with its
  own float / close buttons so individual sections can pop out
  independently, while the outer tray toggle, drag-handle and
  settings all treat the group as one coherent unit.
- CEQ and CMP tile visibility is driven by DSP bypass state — right-
  clicking a stage in the CHAIN widget or toggling the Bypass button
  inside an editor hides the corresponding section; enabling it
  brings the section back.  No separate "show tile" toggle.

**Applet panel pop-out**
- View → "Pop Out Applet Panel" (Ctrl+Shift+S) floats the entire
  right-side panel into its own top-level window.  Splitter slot
  collapses to zero; spectrum takes the reclaimed width.  Close
  the floating window (or toggle the menu item) to dock back at
  the remembered width.  Position and size persist across launches.

**Post-fader level meters on DAX / TCI**
- MeterSlider now multiplies its displayed RMS by the gain thumb
  before rendering, so moving the fader on a TCI or DAX channel
  gives immediate visual feedback instead of showing the raw
  pre-fader level.

**Consistent meter motion — MeterSmoother**
- Extracted the asymmetric attack/release smoothing pattern used
  by HGauge into a shared MeterSmoother helper (30 ms attack,
  180 ms release, polled at 120 Hz).  Applied to HGauge,
  ClientCompMeter, ClientCompApplet's GR strip and MeterSlider so
  every metering surface in the app reads with identical ballistics.

### Fixes

**Digital-mode TX routing**
- AudioEngine bypasses client-side Comp + EQ on the DAX/TCI TX path
  so WSJT-X and fldigi tones reach the radio unshaped.  Mic voice
  TX continues to run through the full client-side DSP chain.
- Fixed limiter envelope that could latch "active" forever after
  any trigger because the envelope decays asymptotically toward
  1.0 in float and never reaches it — now uses a 0.005 dB threshold
  to detect "not firing" which releases the active indicator.

**Compressor editor polish**
- Threshold fader on the left of the compressor editor replaces
  the old numeric label + tiny triangle with a combined input-
  level meter + draggable slider, matching the Client EQ output
  fader visual language.
- Threshold chevron on the curve gained a full-height dashed guide
  line so it reads from across the room; hit-test widened to grab
  anywhere along the vertical column.
- Live tooltips on the threshold chevron and ratio handle show the
  current value and describe the gesture.
- Limiter visualization: bright amber ceiling line on the Output
  meter, dim red "no-go zone" above, cyan GR tick showing how much
  the limiter is reducing, and a three-state LIMIT button
  (disarmed / armed / firing) that glows red for 500 ms after each
  clamp event.

### Under the hood

**Container system (#1713, foundation library)**
- New src/gui/containers/ subsystem: ContainerWidget (generic
  dockable wrapper), ContainerTitleBar (header with float/close/
  drag handle), FloatingContainerWindow (top-level host with
  geometry persistence + screen-visibility safety),
  ContainerManager (lifecycle + path lookup + content factory +
  JSON persistence under the ContainerTree settings key).
- Supports arbitrary nesting — a container's body can hold leaf
  widgets, other containers, or any mix.  Each container has its
  own float/dock/visibility state; transitions cascade correctly
  across parent/child relationships (floated parent takes docked
  children with it, floated child is independent of its parent's
  state, etc.).
- 80-assertion test suite across three harnesses covering
  lifecycle, manager persistence round-trip, and all eight of the
  nested-float/dock/hide edge cases called out in the design plan.
- This release uses the container system for just the TXDSP group.
  Future features needing grouped dockable tiles (RX DSP cluster,
  meter groups, macro panels) build on the same foundation without
  re-litigating the architecture.

**ClientCompKnob refinements**
- Shared rotary knob widget gains a **center-label mode** (draws the
  parameter name inside the ring instead of above) used by every new
  editor so the 270° arc, the label, and the value readout live in a
  tight 76×76 footprint.  Label font auto-shrinks to `diameter / 6`
  so "Thresh" / "Release" render at the same size as "Hold" across a
  knob row.
- Value readout now sits in the empty 90° sector at the bottom of the
  arc instead of below the widget — no gap between ring and value.

### Fixes

**CEQ cascade Q honouring (#1739)**
- Fix regression where HP/LP bands ignored the user-set Q on cascade
  slopes.  Cascade-slope refactor had hardcoded the family Q; new
  `resonanceScale = userQ / 0.707` multiplier restores user control
  of resonance for slopes above 12 dB/oct.

**PUDU monitor audio routing (#1734)**
- Earlier implementation mixed recorded int16 directly into the sink
  (wrong format, blew out speakers) and interleaved playback with
  live RX audio.  Fixed: convert int16→float32 before enqueueing at
  10 ms cadence; mute RX by disconnecting the pan stream ↔ AudioEngine
  signal rather than calling `setMuted()` (which silenced our own
  playback too).

### Client-side TX Compressor (Pro-XL-style, Phase 1) + Fully-interactive 10-band Client EQ

### Features

**Client EQ — 10-band parametric, 4 filter families, output fader (#1650 / #1651 / #1658 / #1660)**
- Client-side 10-band parametric EQ on both RX (post-NR, pre-sink) and
  TX (post-mic, pre-VITA-49) paths.  Default layout: HP / Low Shelf /
  6× Peak / High Shelf / LP, all disabled on first launch
- Each pass (HP / LP) band cascades up to 4 biquad sections for slopes
  of 12 / 24 / 36 / 48 dB/oct; peak / shelf bands stay native 2nd-order
- Global filter-family enum: Butterworth (flat maximal), Chebyshev I
  (1 dB ripple), Bessel (tabulated pole Q/mag for orders 2-8), Elliptic
  (Chebyshev-II-ish approximation).  Display path sums section
  magnitudes in dB from the analog prototype, in double precision, so
  the curve stays clean at all frequencies
- Grabbing a handle or clicking an icon auto-enables the band.  Right-
  click handles for type picker, bypass, reset-to-default; HP / LP also
  get a Slope submenu
- Live post-EQ FFT analyzer overlaid on the response curve (2048-point
  Cooley-Tukey at ~25 Hz, fed from an audio-thread ring buffer with no
  UI-side mutex).  Gradient terminates at the last valid bin so there's
  no misleading plateau above Nyquist
- Combined output-fader widget on the right edge: one custom-painted
  widget with a vertical peak meter, dB scale (0 / -6 / -12 / -20 / -40)
  and a horizontal fader handle that overhangs the bar on both sides.
  Click-drag, wheel for 0.5 dB fine step, double-click resets to 0 dB
- Settings migrate cleanly — existing users' saved bands map into the
  new 10-slot layout

**Client-side TX compressor (Pro-XL-style, Phase 1) (#1661)**
- Feed-forward compressor with soft-knee quadratic interpolation, linear-
  domain peak envelope detection, stereo-linked gain application, and a
  brickwall peak limiter on the output
- Parameters: threshold (-60..0 dB), ratio (1:1..20:1), attack (0.1..300 ms),
  release (5..2000 ms), knee (0..24 dB), makeup (-12..+24 dB), limiter
  enable + ceiling (-24..0 dB)
- Chain-order toggle in the editor: CMP→EQ (default, colour-then-shape)
  or EQ→CMP (shape-then-tame) — the two client-side TX DSP stages now
  run in a user-configurable order
- Atomic parameter handoff from UI to audio thread, lock-free, no alloc
  in process(), identical pattern to ClientEq

**Docked Compressor applet + floating editor**
- View-only CMP tile in the applet tray: live transfer curve with a
  glowing ball that slides along the curve at the current envelope level,
  horizontal GR strip beneath, Bypass toggle + Edit… button
- Full floating editor (Ableton-inspired, extended for our limiter and
  chain order): rotary knobs for Ratio / Attack / Release / Knee /
  Makeup / Ceiling, interactive transfer curve with draggable threshold
  handle + ratio handle, vertical Input / GR / Output meters, Limiter
  enable toggle, chain-order selector, persistent window geometry
- Meter ballistics match Phone/CW Level (30 ms attack, 180 ms release)

**DSP test harness**
- tests/client_comp_test.cpp — 11 standalone smoke tests: bypass,
  below-threshold passthrough, static ratio (4:1 and 20:1), makeup,
  limiter ceiling, stereo linking, attack timing, soft-knee monotonicity,
  transient sanity, reset(). Built as `client_comp_test` CMake target.

**Settings**
- Client EQ: ClientEq{Rx,Tx}_Enabled / ActiveBandCount, per-band
  ClientEq{Rx,Tx}_Band{N}_* (type, freq, gain, Q, slope, enabled),
  ClientEq{Rx,Tx}_FilterFamily, ClientEq{Rx,Tx}_MasterGain, plus
  ClientEqEditorGeometry
- Client Comp: ClientCompTx* keys (Enabled, ThresholdDb, Ratio,
  AttackMs, ReleaseMs, KneeDb, MakeupDb, LimEnabled, LimCeilingDb),
  ClientCompTxChainOrder, ClientCompEditorGeometry

**Docs**
- docs/tx-audio-signal-path.md — new "Client-side TX DSP" section
  showing mic → ClientEq + ClientComp → VITA-49 → radio firmware chain
- docs/architecture-pipelines.md — TX pipeline diagram shows
  applyClientTxDsp stage inserted between onTxAudioReady and the
  voice/DAX/RADE fork

Compressor Phase 2+ (expander/gate, de-esser, tube, enhancer, low
contour, IKA/IRC, lookahead limiter, preset system) tracked in #1661
for future releases.

## [v0.7.17.6] — 2026-04-02

### Reconnect & Disconnect Fixes

**Fix disconnect crash on macOS (#561)**
- `PanadapterStream::stop()` was called from the main thread, crashing
  on macOS by closing the socket from the wrong thread
- Route `stop()` through BlockingQueuedConnection to network thread

**Fix VITA-49 not resuming after reconnect (#561)**
- On reconnect, `start()` was skipped because the socket was still bound
  from the previous session. Always call `start()` on connect — it closes
  and rebinds the socket, re-registering the UDP port with the radio

**Clear spectrum and waterfall on disconnect**
- FFT and waterfall display now blanks immediately on disconnect
- Prevents the display from appearing frozen

---

## [v0.7.17.4] — 2026-04-02

### UI Polish & Stability

### Bug Fixes

**Disconnect button unresponsive (#561)**
- Clicking a radio in the list while connected disabled the Disconnect button
- One-character fix: `!m_connected &&` → `m_connected ||`

- Socket/timer signal connections moved to init() on the network thread
- Fixes "Cannot create children for a parent in a different thread" on macOS
- Prevents duplicate socket notifiers on reconnect

**Scroll wheel 8x on Linux Mint (#556)**
- Added 50ms debounce for desktops that send multiple events per notch
- Combined with existing ±1 clamp for inflated single events

**VFO slider wheel leak (#547 BUG-002)**
- Sliders in VFO panel no longer leak wheel events to frequency scroll
- Scroll over frequency display tunes by step size
- Scroll elsewhere on VFO is consumed (dead zone)

**B/S zoom toggle (#547 ENH-001)**
- B and S buttons now toggle: first press zooms, second press restores

---

## [v0.7.17.3] — 2026-04-02

### Filter Widget, DSP Cleanup & Diagnostics

### New Features

**Visual filter passband widget**
- SmartSDR-style filter control in the RX applet with static trapezoid shape
- Horizontal drag shifts passband, vertical drag adjusts bandwidth
- Numeric labels: lo, hi, bandwidth, and center offset from carrier
- 50 Hz snap grid, minimum 50 Hz bandwidth
- Replaces the DSP toggle buttons in the RX applet

**Frequency reference status bar (#478)**
- Status bar shows actual frequency reference: GPS (with satellite count
  and lock status), Ext 10M, or TCXO
- No more perpetual "Warming" on radios without a GPS antenna
- Uses oscillator status messages from radio for accurate source detection

### Bug Fixes

**Stale process on exit (#527)**
- Suppress reconnect dialog during app shutdown — was keeping the
  process alive on Windows after the main window closed
- Added 3-second timeouts to all thread wait() calls in destructors

**DAX TX level meter (#517)**
- P/CW mic gauge now shows DAX TX input level when DAX is active
- Previously showed nothing because the mic input path returns early
  in DAX mode

**DSP toggles removed from RX applet**
- 9 buttons and 27 sync points eliminated between RxApplet, VfoWidget,
  and spectrum overlay
- DSP controls remain in VFO DSP tab and spectrum overlay menu
- Eliminates triple-state tracking bugs (NR/NR2, RNN/RN2)

---

## [v0.7.17.2] — 2026-04-01

### Bug Fixes & MIDI Improvements

AetherSDR v0.7.17.2 closes 6 user-reported issues, adds MIDI relative knob
support with acceleration, and improves digital mode workflow.

### Bug Fixes

**rigctld cross-band tune (#536)**
- `set_freq` now uses `tuneAndRecenter` so the panadapter follows when
  WSJT-X or other CAT apps change bands (was using `autopan=0`)

**Mouse 8x step on KDE/Cinnamon/Linux Mint (#504)**
- Clamp scroll wheel to ±1 step per event in all scroll handlers:
  SpectrumWidget (VFO tune), RxApplet (freq label), HGauge (TGXL relays)

**Slider labels stale on connect (#544)**
- VFO slider labels (AF Gain, SQL, AGC-T, Pan, ESC, APF) now update
  immediately when the radio pushes status on connect

**S-Meter frozen during TUNE (#491)**
- TUNE bypassed `m_txRequested` so the interlock TRANSMITTING state was
  rejected. S-Meter now switches to forward power during TUNE and MOX.
  Also fixes #499 (power meter no output)

**DAX auto-activate in digital modes (#534)**
- Radio-side DAX flag (`transmit set dax=1`) auto-toggles on mode change
  to/from DIGU/DIGL/RTTY — P/CW DAX button follows automatically
- Client-side DSP (NR2/RN2/BNR) auto-disabled in digital modes to
  prevent data signal corruption
- PipeWire bridge decoupled from DAX flag — use Settings → Auto Start DAX
  for persistent virtual audio devices

**Interlock timing fields not populated (#498)**
- RCA TX1, TX Delay, ACC TX, Timeout now show correct radio values in
  Radio Setup → TX tab (parser existed but was never wired up)

### New Features

**MIDI relative knob mode**
- Relative CC encoding support (1-63 CW, 65-127 CCW)
- 20ms coalesce timer batches rapid steps into single radio commands
- 3-tier acceleration: slow spin = ½ rate (fine tune), fast = 4×
- Snap to step grid (e.g. step=500 → x.x.500, x.x+1.000)
- Radio-authoritative step size — no default until radio sends step=
- "Relative" checkbox in MIDI Mapping dialog, persisted in midi.settings

---

## [v0.7.17.1] — 2026-04-01

### Accurate Network Diagnostics

AetherSDR v0.7.17.1 replaces application-layer RTT measurement with kernel
TCP stack timing, adds per-stream network diagnostics, and fixes DAX
stream lifecycle management.

### Improvements

**Kernel TCP_INFO RTT (#455)**
- RTT now read from the kernel's TCP congestion control (TCP_INFO),
  completely immune to Qt event loop delays
- Linux: `getsockopt(TCP_INFO)` → `tcpi_rtt`
- macOS: `getsockopt(TCP_CONNECTION_INFO)` → `tcpi_srtt`
- Windows: `WSAIoctl(SIO_TCP_INFO)` → `RttUs`
- Falls back to QElapsedTimer stopwatch if kernel call unavailable
- Fixes inflated RTT (40–200ms) that correlated with waterfall load

**Per-stream Network Diagnostics (#455)**
- Network Diagnostics dialog now shows per-stream-type rates:
  Audio, FFT, Waterfall, Meters, DAX
- Per-stream packet loss tracking with sequence error counts
- TX byte counter wired to actual UDP sends
- Total RX from raw socket byte counter
- Matches SmartSDR's reported RX rate (77 kbps on Opus)

**Packet loss accuracy (#455)**
- Sequence tracking moved after ownership filter — no longer counts
  other clients' streams in Multi-Flex mode
- Meter broadcast packets excluded (unreliable sequence counter)
- Eliminates false 28% packet loss reports

**DAX stream cleanup**
- Disabling DAX now sends `stream remove` to the radio and unregisters
  streams from PanadapterStream
- Previously DAX streams persisted until app restart

**Socket write flush**
- `flush()` after `write()` in RadioConnection ensures ping and
  command packets are sent immediately, not buffered by Qt

### Network & Input Responsiveness

AetherSDR v0.7.17 moves all network and external controller I/O off the main
thread, fixing ping RTT inflation and establishing a clean 5-thread architecture.

### Improvements

**RadioConnection worker thread (#502)**
- TCP command/status I/O runs on a dedicated worker thread
- Ping RTT now measures actual network latency, not main thread load
- Fixes "Poor" network status despite zero packet drops
- Response callbacks dispatched on main thread via auto-queued signals
- All external `connection()->sendCommand()` calls routed through RadioModel

**External controllers worker thread (#502)**
- FlexControl USB tuning knob, MIDI controllers, and serial port PTT/CW
  keying now run on a shared ExtControllers worker thread
- USB serial I/O, RtMidi callbacks, and poll timers no longer compete
  with GUI rendering for main thread CPU
- MIDI parameter dispatch via signal to main thread (thread-safe)

### Architecture

Five-thread design: Main (GUI + models), Connection (TCP), Audio (DSP),
Network (VITA-49 UDP), ExtControllers (FlexControl/MIDI/SerialPort).
Each worker thread has a single responsibility and communicates via
auto-queued Qt signals. The main thread handles only rendering and
model dispatch.

### World-First TGXL Relay Control & Global Band Plans

AetherSDR v0.7.16 brings manual control of the 4O3A Tuner Genius XL Pi
network — a world first for any SDR client — and makes the spectrum overlay
useful for operators worldwide with selectable IARU band plans.

### New Features

**Manual TGXL Pi Network Relay Control (#469)**
- Scroll over the C1, L, or C2 relay bars in the Tuner applet to adjust
  relay positions one step at a time

- Cursor changes to ↕ when hovering over scrollable relay bars
- Protocol reverse-engineered from the 4O3A TGXL management app
- First SDR client to support manual TGXL relay control

**Selectable IARU Band Plans (#425)**
- View → Band Plan now includes a region selector:
  ARRL (US), IARU Region 1, Region 2, Region 3
- Region 1: Europe, Africa, Middle East (80m stops at 3.800, 40m at 7.200)
- Region 2: Americas (80m to 4.000, 40m to 7.300)
- Region 3: Asia-Pacific, Oceania (80m to 3.900, 40m to 7.200)
- Each plan includes segment allocations and spot frequency markers
- Plan selection persists across restarts
- Band plan data loaded from bundled JSON resources

  VPN/SD-WAN tunnel MTUs (WireGuard 1420, OpenVPN 1400)
- Confirmed fix by user on Cisco Meraki SD-WAN
- Adjustable in Radio Setup → Network → Advanced

**FFTW thread safety for NR2 (#467)**
- Added mutex to serialize all FFTW plan creation/destruction
- Prevents potential crashes when switching DSP modes or regenerating wisdom
- `fftw_execute()` left unlocked (thread-safe per FFTW spec)

**Removed broken release.yml workflow**
- GitHub Actions release workflow removed (GITHUB_TOKEN PRs can't trigger CI)
- Ship/release now handled locally via Claude using gh CLI and GPG-signed tags

## [v0.7.15] — 2026-03-30

### Digital-Friendly Minimal Mode

AetherSDR v0.7.15 introduces **Minimal Mode** — a streamlined, ultra-compact
interface designed for digital mode operators who want AetherSDR running
alongside WSJT-X, fldigi, or other companion software without dominating
screen real estate.

### New Features

**Minimal Mode (#208)**
- Ctrl+M or ↙ button in the title bar collapses AetherSDR to a 260px-wide
  applet-only strip — just your VFO, RX controls, TX controls, and meters
- Spectrum, waterfall, and status bar are hidden; title bar goes compact
- ↗ button restores full mode instantly with splitter sizes preserved
- All applets remain available and fully functional
- Perfect for digital mode operation: park AetherSDR on one side of the screen
  while your decoder fills the rest

**multiFLEX Dashboard (#56)**
- Settings → multiFLEX opens a live dashboard showing all connected stations
- Per-client display: station name, program, TX antenna, TX frequency
- LOCAL PTT status with checkmarks and "Enable Local PTT" button
- multiFLEX enable/disable toggle
- Real-time updates via client status subscriptions

### Infrastructure

**CI/CD Pipeline**
- Docker-based CI builds in ~3.5 minutes (down from 3–19 min variable)
- CodeQL analysis runs in parallel without blocking merge
- `git ship` squashes local commits into single auto-merge PR
- `git release` automates version bump, changelog PR, tag, and release

## [v0.7.12] — 2026-03-29

### New Features

**GPG Release Signing (#397, #398)**
- Linux AppImage and source archives are GPG-signed with detached `.asc` signatures
- SHA256SUMS.txt generated and signed for each release
- macOS artifacts signed via Apple codesign + notarization (unchanged)
- Public key published at `docs/RELEASE-SIGNING-KEY.pub.asc` and keys.openpgp.org
- Verification guide at `docs/VERIFYING-RELEASES.md`

**Commit Signing**
- All commits to `main` require GPG signatures (branch protection enforced)
- Contributor setup guide in CONTRIBUTING.md

**Configurable Band Plan Size (#406)**
- View → Band Plan submenu: Off, Small (6pt), Medium (10pt), Large (12pt), Huge (16pt)
- Strip height scales with font size
- Replaces the previous on/off checkbox

**Visual Keyboard Shortcut Manager (#239)**
- View → Configure Shortcuts opens a visual keyboard map dialog
- Full ANSI keyboard layout with keys color-coded by action category
- Click any key to assign/change/clear its binding
- ~45 bindable actions across 12 categories (Frequency, Band, Mode, TX, Audio, Slice, Filter, Tuning, DSP, AGC, Display, RIT/XIT)
- Conflict detection with reassign prompt
- Filterable action table with search and category filter
- Reset to defaults (per-key or all)
- Bindings persist across restarts via AppSettings
- Replaces hardcoded keyboard shortcuts with fully customizable bindings

**Click-and-Drag VFO Tuning (#404)**
- Click inside the filter passband and drag left/right to tune the VFO
- Frequency snaps to step size during drag
- Filter edge drag (resize) takes priority within ±5px grab zone

**Go to Frequency (G key)**
- Press G to open the VFO direct frequency entry field
- Pre-fills with current frequency, selected for easy overtype

**Space PTT Hold-to-Transmit**
- Hold Space to transmit, release to return to RX (true momentary PTT)
- Works regardless of which UI widget has focus
- Properly syncs TX state with TX applet and status bar

### Bug Fixes

**NR2/RN2/BNR Crash on DSP Mode Switch**
- SEGV in SpectralNR::process() when switching from BNR to NR2
- Root cause: enabled flag was set before the DSP object was constructed; audio arriving during the transition called process() on a null object
- Fix: set enabled flag AFTER construction succeeds; clear flag BEFORE destruction

**FlexControl UI Lag (#379)**
- Each encoder step sent a separate TCP command, flooding the radio
- Fix: coalesce rapid encoder steps into a single command every 20ms

**FlexControl Menu Stub (#380)**
- Settings → FlexControl showed "not implemented"
- Fix: wired to open Radio Setup dialog on the Serial tab

**TNF Crash on +TNF Click (#381)**
- SIGBUS on macOS when clicking +TNF after a panadapter layout change
- Root cause: rebuildTnfMarkers lambda captured raw SpectrumWidget pointer that became dangling when the pan was removed
- Fix: capture QPointer instead; also fixed duplicate `tnf create` commands per click

**FlexControl ToggleMox/ToggleTune Stuck in TX (#382)**
- Pressing the FlexControl button a second time didn't toggle TX off
- Root cause: `applyTransmitStatus()` never parsed `mox=` from radio status, so `isMox()` always returned false
- Fix: parse `mox=` key in transmit status updates

**VFO Lock Icon Not Updating (#384)**
- Lock icon on VFO overlay didn't update when toggled via FlexControl or RxApplet
- Root cause: VfoWidget::setSlice() connected 30+ SliceModel signals but was missing `lockedChanged`
- Fix: added the missing signal connection

**Mouse Wheel 8x Step on KDE/Cinnamon (#390, #405)**
- Tuning steps were 8x the selected step size on Linux Mint, Cinnamon, and KDE Plasma
- Root cause: these desktops send high-resolution angleDelta (960 per notch instead of 120)
- Fix: accumulate angleDelta and normalize to 120 units per step

**ESC Gain Slider Black Thumb (#394)**
- ESC gain slider thumb was invisible (black) on macOS and Windows
- Root cause: kSliderStyle only defined horizontal handle rules; ESC gain slider is vertical
- Fix: added vertical groove and handle QSS rules

**RxApplet NR2 Button Not Working (#329)**
- Cycling the RX panel NR button to NR2 didn't enable noise reduction
- Root cause: the `nr2CycleToggled` handler only synced the VFO button visual but never called `enableNr2WithWisdom()`
- Fix: NR2 now actually enables when cycled from the RX panel, matching VFO and overlay buttons

**Split Slice on Wrong Pan (#328)**
- In multi-pan mode, clicking SPLIT could create the TX slice on the wrong panadapter
- Root cause: split used `m_activePanId` (global) instead of the RX slice's actual pan
- Fix: use `rxSlice->panId()` for the `slice create` command
- Bonus: CW split now offsets 1 kHz up (standard convention), other modes 5 kHz

## [v0.7.11] — 2026-03-29


### New Features

**Panadapter Click-to-Spot (#36)**
- Right-click on the panadapter to create a spot marker with callsign, comment, and configurable lifetime
- Optionally forward spots to your connected DX cluster
- Right-click on existing spots: Tune, Copy Callsign, QRZ Lookup, Remove
- Spot frequency snaps to tuning step size

**Per-Slice Record & Play (#164)**
- Record (⏺) and Play (▶) buttons on each VFO flag, matching SmartSDR placement
- Record button pulses red while recording
- Play disabled until a recording exists (radio-managed)
- TX playback: press MOX then Play for a built-in voice keyer

**DAX IQ Streaming (#124)**
- Raw I/Q data from the radio's DDC to external SDR apps (SDR#, GQRX, GNU Radio)
- 4 IQ channels at 24/48/96/192 kHz via PulseAudio virtual capture devices
- DIGI applet: per-channel rate dropdown, level meters, On/Off toggle
- Spectrum overlay: IQ channel routing selector per panadapter
- Dedicated worker thread for byte-swap and pipe I/O at high sample rates

- ☰ hamburger icon in the status bar toggles the right applet panel
- Spectrum/waterfall expands to full width when panel is hidden
- Also available via View → Applet Panel checkbox
- Custom painted +PAN spectrum icon replaces text label

**Drag-Reorderable Applets (#335)**
- Drag applets by their ⋮⋮ grip title bars to reorder in the panel
- Order persists across sessions
- View → Reset Applet Order to restore defaults
- Built on QDrag framework (future-proofs for pop-out to floating windows)

**Opus Codec Independent of RADE (#375)**
- SmartLink compressed audio now works without the RADE digital voice module
- System libopus detected via pkg-config when RADE is disabled
- Windows: setup-opus.ps1 builds static opus from source

**Modeless Dialogs**
- SpotHub, Radio Setup, and MIDI Mapping dialogs no longer block the main window
- Interact with the radio while dialogs are open

### Bug Fixes

**BNR Crash Fix (#376)**
- r8brain resampler buffer overflow — BNR output can return up to 9,600 samples at once but the resampler was allocated for 4,096. Increased to 16,384. Found and verified via ASAN.

**AppSettings Corruption Prevention**
- Atomic save: write to .tmp file, validate XML, rename over original
- Backup recovery: auto-recover from .bak if main file is corrupt
- Count guard: refuse to save if settings count dropped below half of loaded count
- Key validation: skip keys with invalid XML element name characters

**RadioModel Shutdown Use-After-Free**
- Disconnect all signals from RadioConnection before member destruction
- Prevents accessing destroyed XVTR map and slice models during teardown
- Found via AddressSanitizer (ASAN) build

**Opus SSE Alignment**
- Copy input data to alignas(16) buffers before opus_encode/opus_decode
- Prevents SEGV on SSE-optimized RADE opus builds

**Spot Label Deconfliction**
- Re-scan all placed labels after each nudge to properly stack across all levels
- Spots no longer overlap when multiple labels are close in frequency

**Other Fixes**
- Duplicate spot-to-cluster sends fixed (disconnect before reconnect in wirePanadapter)
- DIGI applet section headers use distinct label style (not confused with draggable title bars)
- DIGI applet layout: CAT Control and DAX Enable rows moved below their channel status for cleaner visual flow

### Platform Notes

- DAX IQ pipe output is Linux/macOS only. Windows DAX IQ support tracked in #87.
- Opus standalone requires system libopus on Linux (`libopus-dev`) or macOS (`brew install opus`). Windows builds from source via setup-opus.ps1.

- **MIDI CW keying** — straight key (`cw.key`), iambic dit/dah paddles (`cw.dit`/`cw.dah`), and PTT hold (`cw.ptt`) via new Gate param type. CW speed also mappable. (#295)

### Spots
- **Hover tooltips** — hover over any spot label to see callsign, frequency, source, spotter, comment, and spotted time
- **Spot trigger on click** — clicking a spot sends `spot trigger <index>` to the radio so external logging software sees the click (#341)
- **Lines stop at label** — spot dotted lines draw from bottom of spectrum to the label only, no clutter above (#337)
- **Cross-band tuning** — clicking a spot on a different band in SpotHub now tunes AND recenters the panadapter (#352)

### Panadapter
- **3v / 4v layouts** — 3 and 4 vertical pan stacking options in the layout chooser (#312)
- **Single-click-to-tune** — configurable in View menu (off by default). When enabled, single left-click on spectrum/waterfall tunes immediately (#342)

### Bug Fixes
- **Line out volume** — master volume slider controls radio line out when PC Audio is disabled (#244, #351)
- **Audio preserved on profile change** — profile load no longer switches audio to PC when listening through radio speakers (#336)
- **CW decode after profile change** — deferred re-check restarts decoder when mode status arrives after profile load (#305)
- **XVTR band stack** — added 2m, 1.25m, 440, 33cm, 23cm to band frequency lookup. Band stack save/restore now works for all XVTR bands (#346)
- **Full model reset on disconnect** — all radio-specific state (APD, tuner, amplifier, XVTR, power levels) resets when switching between different radio models (#359)
- **Bundled RtMidi** — MIDI controller support works on all platforms (Linux/macOS/Windows) without external package dependency

---

## [v0.7.7] — 2026-03-28


**AetherSDR v0.7.7 introduces SpotHub** — a completely new, unified spot management system that brings DX spotting to Linux ham radio like never before. Four spot sources. One panadapter. Zero external tools required.

---

## Introducing SpotHub

Gone are the days of running separate Python scripts, telnet clients, and browser tabs just to see who's on the air. SpotHub brings it all together in a single dialog (**Settings → SpotHub**) with six tabs:

### DX Cluster
Connect to any DX Spider, AR-Cluster, or CC Cluster node via telnet. Full interactive console with command input. See every spot the moment it hits the cluster — right on your panadapter.

### Reverse Beacon Network (RBN)
Automated CW/RTTY/FT8 skimmer spots from the worldwide RBN network. Built-in rate limiting prevents command flooding during contests. Connect to `telnet.reversebeacon.net` and let the skimmers do the work.

### WSJT-X Decode Spotter
**This is the big one.** AetherSDR listens for WSJT-X decode messages via UDP multicast and spots every station you can hear — directly on the panadapter. Features:
- **Smart filters**: Show only CQ calls, CQ POTA, or stations calling *you*
- **Color-coded by category**: Green for CQ, Cyan for CQ POTA, Red for stations calling you
- **SNR-based transparency**: Strong signals pop with full opacity, weak ones fade — you see propagation at a glance
- **Configurable lifetime**: 30-300 second spot decay, tuned for the fast pace of digital modes

### POTA (Parks on the Air)
Real-time POTA activation feed polling `api.pota.app`. See every active park activation on your panadapter with park reference, park name, and mode. Spot lifetime synced to the POTA API's own expiry timer. Never miss an activator again.

### Spot List
All spots from all sources in one sortable, filterable table. Band filter checkboxes (160m-6m). Source column tells you where each spot came from. Double-click any row to tune. Smart auto-scroll that pauses when you're reading and resumes when you scroll back.

### Display Controls
Full control over how spots render on the panadapter: label levels, position, font size, colors, background opacity, and spot lifetime.

---

## Per-Source Color Coding

Every spot source has its own configurable color:

| Source | Default Color | What You See |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| DX Cluster | Tan | Classic cluster spots |
| RBN | Blue | Skimmer detections |
| WSJT-X | Green/Cyan/Red/White | Per-filter category colors |
| POTA | Yellow | Park activations |

Colors are sent to the radio via the FlexRadio spot API — they render natively on the panadapter with no client-side override needed.

## Spot Density Badges

When spots pile up (and they will), overlapping labels collapse into amber **+N** badges. Click a badge to expand a popup showing every collapsed callsign with its frequency. Click any entry to tune. No more unreadable label soup.

## Deduplication

Cross-source dedup ensures the same callsign on the same frequency doesn't flood your panadapter. If a station QSYs, the old spot is replaced. Each source uses its own appropriate lifetime for dedup timing.

## Worker Thread Architecture

All four spot sources run on a dedicated worker thread. Network I/O, protocol parsing, and log file writing happen completely off the main GUI thread. Spots are batched and forwarded to the radio once per second — smooth, efficient, and invisible.

---

## Other Fixes in This Release

- **SmartLink reconnect fix** (#224) — Signal connection leak that prevented switching between SmartLink radios
- **Version in title bar** (#315) — Window title now shows "AetherSDR vX.X.X"
- **Spot label hover cursor** — Pointing hand cursor on spot labels and density badges

---

## Upgrade Notes

Drop-in replacement for v0.7.6.x. No new required dependencies. SpotHub settings are saved to `~/.config/AetherSDR/AetherSDR.settings` on first use.

---

Built with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code). 73 de KK7GWY.

---

## [v0.7.6.1] — 2026-03-28

## Bug Fix

- **Fix SmartLink reconnect signal leak** — `WanConnection` signal connections in `RadioModel::connectViaWan()` were never disconnected on teardown, causing duplicate signal delivery on each reconnect cycle. This prevented users from switching between SmartLink radios or cleanly disconnecting and reconnecting. (#224)

## Upgrade

Drop-in replacement for v0.7.6. No new dependencies or settings changes.

---

## [v0.7.6] — 2026-03-27

## Highlights

### NVIDIA NIM BNR — GPU-Accelerated AI Noise Removal (#288)

**A world first for SDR clients.** AetherSDR v0.7.6 introduces real-time GPU-accelerated neural noise removal powered by NVIDIA Maxine BNR, running on your local RTX GPU via a self-hosted Docker container.

- **Neural denoising** trained on massive audio datasets — superior to classical spectral (NR2) and RNNoise (RN2) approaches
- **Real-time gRPC streaming** — 48kHz mono float32, 10ms processing chunks, ~15ms total added latency
- **Intensity control** — adjustable denoising strength (0–100%) via slider in DSP panel
- **Jitter buffer** — 50ms priming for smooth, uninterrupted playback
- **Container management** — Start/Stop/Status in Radio Setup → Audio, optional autostart on app launch
- **Zero-config audio** — BNR button in VFO DSP tab and spectrum overlay, 3-way mutual exclusion with NR2/RN2

**Requirements:** NVIDIA RTX 4000+ GPU (Ada Lovelace or newer), Docker + NVIDIA Container Toolkit, NGC API key (free).

```bash
docker login nvcr.io  # Username: $oauthtoken, Password: <NGC API key>
docker run -d --gpus all --shm-size=8gb \
  -p 8001:8001 -p 8000:8000 \

cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

### ESC Diversity Beamforming (#20, #38)

- **DIV toggle** in VFO audio tab enables dual-SCU diversity reception
- **ESC controls** — polar display (phase=angle, gain=radius), horizontal phase slider (0–360° in 5° steps), vertical gain slider (0.0–2.0)
- **Real-time ESC meter** — signal strength bar after ESC processing
- Protocol verified against SmartSDR pcap: `esc=on/off`, phase in radians, DiversityChild guard per FlexLib
- Requires DIV_ESC license (SmartSDR+) and dual-SCU radio

### Band Zoom Buttons

- **S** (Segment) and **B** (Band) buttons at bottom-left of waterfall
- Uses radio-native `segment_zoom=1` / `band_zoom=1` commands (SmartSDR protocol)

## Bug Fixes

- **XVTR band switch crash** — QPointer prevents SEGV when panadapter destroyed during band change
- **CW decoder not working on first pan** — initial applet wasn't wired through setActivePanApplet()
- **Band change panadapter not scrolling** — use tuneAndRecenter() instead of autopan=0
- **VFO widget not shrinking** — fixed setFixedWidth constraining height when ESC panel hidden
- **Null pointer guards** — m_panApplet checked before setCwPanelVisible() calls

## Build

```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DENABLE_BNR=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

## [v0.7.5] — 2026-03-27

## What's New

### ESC (Enhanced Signal Clarity) — Diversity Beamforming (#20, #38)
- **DIV toggle** in VFO audio tab enables dual-SCU diversity reception
- **ESC controls**: toggle button, horizontal phase slider (0–360° in 5° steps), vertical gain slider (0.0–2.0)
- **Polar display**: crosshair circle with dot positioned by phase (angle) and gain (radius from center)
- **Real-time ESC meter**: signal strength bar after ESC processing (SLC/ESC meter, 10 fps)
- Protocol matches SmartSDR pcap: `esc=on/off`, phase in radians, DiversityChild guard per FlexLib
- ESC panel visible only on diversity parent slice — child slices show DIV but not ESC controls
- Requires DIV_ESC feature license (SmartSDR+ or higher)
- Dual-SCU radios only: FLEX-8600(M), FLEX-6700(R), FLEX-6600(M), AU-520(M)

### Bug Fixes
- **Band change panadapter scroll**: switching bands now recenters the panadapter on the new frequency (was sending `autopan=0` which prevented scrolling)
- **VFO widget resize**: panel properly shrinks when DIV is disabled (fixed `setFixedWidth` constraining height)

## Install
Download the appropriate package for your platform from the assets below, or build from source:

## [v0.7.4] — 2026-03-26

## What's New in v0.7.4

### VOX Support — #253
AetherSDR now creates a `remote_audio_tx` stream on connect and continuously streams mic audio to the radio during RX. This enables the radio's VOX (Voice-Operated Transmit) detection via `met_in_rx=1`.

Previously, only `dax_tx` streams were created and mic audio was only sent during active transmit — so VOX had no audio to monitor and could never trigger.

The DAX TX path is unchanged (only sends during active transmit to prevent mic bleed into digital modes). VOX audio flows on a separate `remote_audio_tx` stream with its own accumulator.

### Profile Load Fix — #289
Applying a global profile no longer causes the FFT spectrum to disappear. The radio resets `x_pixels`/`y_pixels` to defaults during profile application — AetherSDR now detects this and automatically re-pushes correct widget dimensions.

### Band Stack Alignment Fix — #279, #291
Removed bandwidth and center from band stack save/restore. Both are radio-authoritative per FlexLib API — pushing stale saved values caused FFT/waterfall horizontal misalignment on band changes. Only dBm scale (a client display preference) is persisted.

## [v0.7.3.1] — 2026-03-26

## v0.7.3.1 Hotfix

Fixes two regressions introduced in v0.7.3:

### Profile Load Blank Spectrum — #289
Applying a global profile caused the FFT spectrum to disappear. The radio resets `x_pixels`/`y_pixels` to defaults (50/20) during profile application, overwriting our correct widget dimensions. Now automatically detects when the radio reports small pixel values in status and re-pushes the actual widget dimensions.

### FFT/Waterfall Alignment on Band Change — #279, #291
Switching bands caused horizontal misalignment between FFT spectrum and waterfall. The band stack was saving and restoring **bandwidth** (a radio-authoritative setting per FlexLib API), which overrode the radio's bandwidth and created a timing mismatch. Removed bandwidth and center from band stack persistence — only dBm scale (a client-side display preference) is saved/restored.

### Also included from v0.7.3 post-release
- Title bar speaker mute now controls local PC audio engine (#259)
- VFO tab bar speaker icon toggles muted/unmuted on right-click (#283)

## [v0.7.3] — 2026-03-26

## What's New in v0.7.3

### DVK (Digital Voice Keyer) — #19
- **12-slot recording panel** with F1-F12 hotkeys, REC/STOP/PLAY/PREV buttons
- **Elapsed timer** with 100ms resolution and per-slot progress bars (red/green/blue by operation)
- **Right-click context menu**: Rename, Clear, Delete, Import WAV, Export WAV
- **Inline name editing** via double-click, with forbidden character stripping
- **WAV export** (download): reverse TCP transfer from radio to local file
- **WAV import** (upload): validates format (2-ch, 32-bit float, 48 kHz, max 5 MB), TCP streaming to radio
- **Mode-aware availability**: DVK enabled only in voice modes (USB/LSB/AM/SAM/FM/NFM/DFM)
- **Empty slot guards**: prevents TX on empty slots, disables Clear/Delete/Export for empty slots

### CWX/DVK Panel Management
- CWX enabled only in CW/CWL modes, DVK only in voice modes
- Three indicator states: active (cyan), available (dim), unavailable (dark grey)
- Auto-close on mode switch, mutual exclusion between panels
- 4-pane splitter layout fix (CWX + DVK + PanStack + AppletPanel) — #281

### FFT/Waterfall Alignment Fix — #279
- Removed hardcoded xpixels=1024 in RadioModel::configurePan() that overwrote correct widget dimensions
- FFT spectrum and native waterfall tiles now align horizontally at all window sizes

### FFT dBm Calibration Fix
- Bin conversion now uses actual y_pixels from radio status (bins are pixel Y positions, not 0-65535)
- Tracks y_pixels from radio status updates for correct dBm scaling across different display sizes

### Mute Controls — #259, #283
- **Title bar speaker button** now mutes local PC audio engine (was only muting radio line out)
- **VFO tab bar speaker icon** toggles between muted/unmuted to show mute state at a glance
- **Right-click speaker icon** on VFO tab bar toggles mute directly (matches SmartSDR)

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/compare/v0.7.2...v0.7.3

---

## [v0.7.2] — 2026-03-25

## Bug Fixes

- **Per-slice step size from radio** (#274, #241) — Step size and step list are now driven entirely by the radio's per-slice, per-mode status. The RX applet stepper dynamically rebuilds when switching slices or modes. Removed client-side step overwrite that was fighting the radio's mode-specific defaults.

- **Antenna Genius discovery retry** — If the UDP port 9007 bind fails at startup (e.g. another process holds the port), AetherSDR now retries every 5 seconds until it succeeds. Once detected, the AG persists for the app lifetime. Previously a failed bind meant the AG was never detected.

## Policy

- **Radio-authoritative settings** — Documented and enforced the policy that the radio is always authoritative for any setting it stores. AetherSDR only persists client-side settings the radio doesn't know about. This prevents the radio and client from fighting on reconnect.

## [v0.7.1] — 2026-03-25


Bug fixes, multi-pan stability improvements, and new CW/spot controls.

### Multi-Pan Improvements
- **Radio-authoritative pan restore** — radio restores pans from GUIClientID session, client arranges layout (no more creating/removing pans on startup)
- **Close pan via X button** — click the X on any pan's title bar to close it and auto-rearrange remaining pans
- **Defensive xpixels re-push** — 500ms delayed re-push ensures all pans get proper FFT bin resolution after connect
- **TGXL/PGXL meter separation** — meters routed by amplifier handle so TGXL and PGXL gauges don't cross-contaminate

### CW Decoder Controls
- **Lock Pitch** button — prevents decoder from wandering to noise after finding the CW tone
- **Lock Speed** button — locks WPM to current detected value
- **Pitch Range sliders** (Lo/Hi) — constrain decoder frequency search window (300-1200 Hz)
- **Numeric Hz labels** on pitch range sliders with dynamic tooltips

### Spot Settings Enhancements (#260)
- **Color picker** for spot text override color
- **Color picker** for spot background override color
- **Background Opacity** slider (0-100)
- **Live preview** — all changes apply immediately to the spectrum

### Bug Fixes
- **macOS trackpad scroll-to-tune** (#266) — handle pixelDelta for trackpad, ignore momentum scrolling
- **FWDPWR/SWR meter source** (#233) — match "TX-" not just "TX" for exciter power
- **S-Meter TX power with PGXL** — shows amplifier output power when PGXL is connected
- **Title bar mute toggles** (#259) — click speaker/headphone icons to mute/unmute line out and headphones
- **Filter polarity normalization** — DIGU/USB modes correct negative filter offsets from radio session restore
- **Band stack filter recall** — only recalls filter when saved mode matches recalled mode

### Known Issues
- CW sidetone not yet available through PC Audio (radio sends sidetone to physical outputs only, client-side generation deferred)
- `sub codec all` subscription rejected on firmware v4.1.5 (harmless)

## [v0.6.2] — 2026-03-24


## Band Stacking Registers

Per-band save/recall is here. When you switch bands using the spectrum overlay, AetherSDR remembers your last settings and restores them when you come back.

**Saved per band:** frequency, mode, AGC mode + threshold, RX/TX antenna, squelch, step size, all DSP flags (NR, NB, ANF, NRL, NRS, RNN, NRF, ANFL, ANFT, APF, NR2, RN2), pan bandwidth (zoom), and dBm scale.

First visit to a band uses the static default. Subsequent visits recall your last settings. Settings persist across restarts.

## Multi-Pan Improvements

- **Per-pan band change** — each pan's band buttons now target the correct slice, not the global active slice
- **Pan recenters on band change** — FFT/waterfall follows the VFO when switching bands across pans
- **Correct slice labels** — each pan shows the right slice letter (A, B, C, D)
- **Cross-band save guard** — prevents frequency contamination between bands in multi-pan mode
- **Widget cleanup on pan removal** — prevents crashes when reducing pan layouts

## Per-Slice Step Size

The radio sends per-slice step sizes and step lists (different for CW vs SSB vs digital). AetherSDR now parses these and syncs the RX applet stepper when switching between slices. The correct step list is shown per mode.

## New Features

- **Frequency auto-calibration** — Radio Setup → RX tab: Cal Frequency field + Start button + Offset display
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — View → Keyboard Shortcuts (off by default): arrow keys, step cycle, PTT, mute, tune lock
- **DX spot display** — spots from external tools (FlexSpots, N1MM, etc.) appear as clickable labels on the panadapter
- **Spot click-to-tune** — click a spot label to tune to that frequency
- **Spot settings** — Settings → Spots: enable/disable, font size, max stacking levels, color overrides

## Bug Fixes

- Fix GCC 13 internal compiler error on Ubuntu 24.04 (#254)
- Fix filter polarity on session restore (wrong-side passband for DIGU/USB)
- Fix FWDPWR/SWR meter on all radios — source matching was too strict (#233)
- Fix TGXL handle: accept initial 0x00000000 and upgrade to real handle
- Fix SmartLink: use UPnP ports when manual port forwards are absent (#230)
- Fix preamp sync: shared antenna hardware state propagated to all pans (#232)
- Fix crash in mhzToX during band transitions (divide by zero with spots visible)
- Fix Windows support bundle: resolve symlink to actual log file (#243)
- Fix memory recall to use per-pan commands (#236)
- Improved log file handling and diagnostics

- Pre-populated from radio's `cal_freq` on connect

## Bug Fixes

- **Fix FWDPWR/SWR meter reading zero on all radios** (#233) — meter source is `TX-` not `TX`, broke in v0.5.8 PGXL fix
- **Fix SmartLink connection on UPnP radios** (#230) — now parses `public_upnp_tls_port`/`public_upnp_udp_port` (was connecting to port 65535)
- **Fix TGXL buttons not working** — handle was stuck at 0x00000000 from initial status, now upgrades to real handle
- **Fix preamp sync in Multi-Flex** (#232) — antenna preamp is shared hardware, now applied to all pans regardless of client
- **Fix VFO NR2 button not working** (#227) — connections now permanent per-VFO, not re-wired on focus switch
- **Fix scroll-to-tune only going one direction** — same-pan tuning uses immediate model update path
- **Fix crash on pan removal with active spots** — spot rebuild lambda now guarded with QPointer
- **Fix Windows support bundle** (#243) — resolves .lnk symlink to actual log file

## Multi-Pan Improvements

- Per-pan bandwidth, center, and dBm range drag commands (#236) — drags on one pan no longer affect other pans
- Layout restore on reconnect uses `applyPanLayout` to handle pan count mismatch from split mode

## [v0.6.0] — 2026-03-24


**Multi-pan is here!** This release introduces experimental support for multiple simultaneous panadapters on FlexRadio transceivers.

> ⚠️ **Experimental Feature** — Multi-panadapter support is functional but still under active development. Some interactions between pans may behave unexpectedly. We need your help testing and finding bugs. Please report any issues you encounter on the [Issues](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/issues) page.

## Multi-Panadapter Highlights

- **Layout Picker** — click +PAN in the status bar to choose from available layout options:
  - A / B (2 vertical), A | B (2 horizontal)
  - A|B / C (2 top + 1 bottom), A / B|C (1 top + 2 bottom)
  - A|B / C|D (2×2 grid), Single (1 pan)
- **Independent FFT + waterfall** per pan with native VITA-49 tile routing
- **Independent display settings** per pan (AVG, FPS, fill, gain, black level)
- **Click-to-tune** uses SmartSDR protocol (`slice m <freq> pan=<panId>`)
- **Layout persistence** — saved across restarts
- **Pan reduction** — switch from more pans to fewer, excess pans close automatically
- Dual-SCU radios (FLEX-6600/6700/8600, AU-520): up to 4 pans
- Single-SCU radios (FLEX-6400/8400, AU-510): up to 2 pans

## Other New Features

- **Heartbeat indicator** — title bar circle flashes green on each TCP ping, blinks red on missed beats
- **Keepalive ping** — sends `keepalive enable` + 1s ping timer (matches FlexLib protocol)
- **Reconnect dialog** — "Radio disconnected — Waiting for reconnect" on unexpected disconnect with auto-reconnect
- **Fast disconnect detection** — 5s discovery stale timeout with TCP ping fallback for routed/SmartLink
- **Low Bandwidth Connect** — connection panel checkbox for VPN/LTE/metered connections
- **PA inhibit during TUNE** — opt-in safety feature disables ACC TX output before tune, restores after
- **VFO TX badge toggle** — click to assign OR unassign TX from any slice
- **TGXL OPERATE disables TUNE/ATU/MEM** — TX applet buttons dimmed when external tuner is in OPERATE mode
- **VFO slider value labels** — AF gain, SQL, AGC-T show numeric values
- **RIT/XIT offset lines** — dashed lines on panadapter showing actual RX/TX frequencies
- **RTTY mark/space lines** — dashed M/S frequency lines on panadapter in RTTY mode
- **Multi-Flex indicator** — green "multiFLEX" badge in title bar with hover tooltip
- **Step size persistence** — tuning step saved across restarts
- **RTTY mark default from radio** — reads radio's value on connect
- **Show TX in Waterfall** — waterfall freezes during TX when disabled, multi-pan aware
- **Network MTU setting** — Radio Setup → Network → Advanced
- **XVTR panel** — 2×4 grid with auto-grow for configured bands
- **Fill slider label fix** — display panel Fill slider updates label
- **Additional protocol subscriptions** — cwx, dax, daxiq, radio, codec, dvk, usb_cable, spot, license

## Bug Fixes

- Fix volume slider sync: parse `audio_level` not `audio_gain` (#161)
- Fix exciter forward power disappearing when PGXL connected (#181)
- Fix NR2/RN2 button sync between spectrum overlay, VFO, and RX applet
- Fix NR2 freeze: spectrum overlay bypassed FFTW wisdom generation (#214)
- Fix crash on exit: proper MainWindow destructor stops DSP before teardown (#167)
- Fix SQL button showing enabled in digital modes (#192)
- Fix TNF toggle sending no command (#184)
- Fix FDX toggle: optimistic update since radio doesn't echo status (#188)
- Fix DAX channel not persisting (#180)
- Fix profile save overwrite UX (#177)

## Protocol Discoveries (SmartSDR pcap analysis)

- SmartSDR **never sends `slice set <id> active=1`** — active slice is client-side only
- Click-to-tune uses `slice m <freq> pan=<panId>` with radio-side slice routing
- Per-pan `xpixels/ypixels` must be pushed after creation (radio defaults to 50×20)
- Waterfall tiles use stream ID 0x42xxxxxx (distinct from FFT's 0x40xxxxxx)
- `keepalive enable` + `ping ms_timestamp=` every 1 second

## Known Multi-Pan Issues

- Bandwidth drag may affect rates on other pans (#236)
- Split mode interaction with multi-pan needs further testing
- Per-pan display settings are not pushed on reconnect (second pan gets radio defaults)
- Visual stepping when adding pans (pans appear one at a time before rearranging)

## SmartLink Remote Operation — Now Working!

Operate your FlexRadio over the internet from Linux. Connect via SmartLink and get full spectrum, waterfall, audio, and meters — just like being on the local network.

### What's new

- **SmartLink VITA-49 UDP streaming** — FFT spectrum, waterfall tiles, RX audio (float32 stereo), and meter data now stream over WAN. Previously only the TLS command channel worked; now the full receive path is functional.
- **WAN UDP registration protocol** — Implements FlexLib's `client udp_register handle=0x<HANDLE>` sent via UDP datagram (not TCP `client udpport`, which the radio rejects on WAN connections with error `0x500000AA`).
- **NAT pinhole keepalive** — Sends `client ping handle=0x<HANDLE>` via UDP every 5 seconds to maintain the NAT mapping for sustained remote sessions.
- **Pre-bound UDP socket** — Binds the VITA-49 UDP port before requesting SmartLink connection, passing `hole_punch_port` to the relay server so the radio knows where to send packets.
- **SmartLink debug logging** — Comprehensive logging across the full WAN connection flow (Auth0, SmartLink server, TLS handshake, UDP registration, VITA-49 packet arrival) for troubleshooting.
- **Fixed log file path** — Logs now write to `~/.config/AetherSDR/aethersdr.log` (was double-nested).
- **macOS DAX virtual audio bridge** (PR #93) — CoreAudio HAL plugin for DAX audio devices on macOS.
- **Fixed low SSB voice TX level** (PR #94) — +24 dB gain compensation for USB mic input.

### SmartLink requirements

- FlexRadio with SmartSDR+ subscription
- UPnP enabled on the radio's router (or manual UDP port forwarding for port 4993)
- NAT hole-punching for radios without UPnP is not yet implemented

### Known limitations

- Audio may be jittery on high-latency connections (jitter buffer not yet implemented)
- Opus compressed audio (PCC 0x8005) not yet supported — uses uncompressed float32 (~384 kbps)
- No WAN auto-reconnect on connection loss

### Tested

FLEX-8600 fw v4.1.5 via SmartLink with UPnP — all four VITA-49 stream types confirmed working (FFT 0x8003, waterfall 0x8004, audio 0x03E3, meters 0x8002) at ~330 KB/s sustained.

## [v0.4.11] — 2026-03-19


### PC Audio Toggle
New **PC** button on the VFO widget audio tab controls whether audio plays through your PC speakers or the radio's physical outputs (line out, headphone, front speaker).

- **PC ON** (green, default) — audio streams to your PC via `remote_audio_rx`
- **PC OFF** (grey) — audio plays through the radio's line out / headphone / front speaker

This fixes the issue where users with powered speakers connected to the radio's line out jack couldn't hear audio (#71). The radio mutes its physical outputs when a `remote_audio_rx` stream is active — toggling PC Audio OFF removes that stream.

The setting persists across sessions.

## [v0.4.10] — 2026-03-18


### Critical: Audio Fix for Ubuntu/Debian
- **AppImage rebuilt with Qt 6.7 via aqtinstall on Ubuntu 22.04 base** — fixes empty audio device dropdowns and no audio output on Ubuntu 24.04, Debian 12+, and other modern distros
- Root cause: Ubuntu 22.04's Qt 6.2.4 had no separate multimedia plugin — linuxdeploy couldn't bundle it. Now using Qt 6.7.3 which ships the multimedia backend as a proper loadable plugin
- Bundles GStreamer audio plugins (pulseaudio, alsa, pipewire) directly in the AppImage
- **48kHz fallback**: AudioEngine now automatically upsamples RX (24k→48k) and downsamples TX (48k→24k) for devices that don't natively support 24kHz
- Diagnosed with help from a second Claude instance running inside an Ubuntu 24.04 VM

### XVTR Transverter Support
- XVTR button in band grid opens transverter sub-panel with configured bands
- "HF" button returns to regular band grid
- Context-aware frequency entry: on XVTR bands, bare integers get decimal after 3rd digit (1446 → 144.6 MHz)

### Direct Frequency Entry
- Double-click the frequency display (VFO widget or RX applet) to type a frequency
- Accepts: 14.225 (MHz), 14225 (kHz), 14225000 (Hz), 14.225.000 (dotted)

### NR2 UX Improvements
- 3-state NR button: Off → NR → NR2 → Off
- FFTW wisdom dialog: progress after each plan, breathing animation, auto-close messaging

### Windows Fix
- Bundle `libfftw3-3.dll` in Windows ZIP (fixes #81)

### 4O3A Antenna Genius Support (contributed by @EI6JGB)
- UDP discovery, TCP control, per-port antenna grid, band→antenna memory

## [v0.4.9] — 2026-03-18


### AppImage Audio Fix (Ubuntu/Debian)
The AppImage now bundles GStreamer and PipeWire multimedia plugins. This fixes the no-audio issue reported on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (#75) where the PC audio device list was empty despite system audio working normally.

### Firmware Update Staging
New staged firmware update workflow in Settings → Radio Setup → Radio tab:
- **Check for Update** queries FlexRadio's website and compares versions
- **Download** fetches the SmartSDR installer, verifies MD5 against published hash
- **Extract** carves the .ssdr firmware file from the installer binary
- **Validate** checks the extracted file header before enabling upload
- **Browse .ssdr** still available for manual file selection
- Experimental feature — disclaimer included

### NR2 UX Polish
- 3-state NR button cycle in RX Applet: Off → NR → NR2 → Off
- NR2 toggle added to DSP side panel
- All NR2 buttons sync bidirectionally
- Buttons only show "on" after wisdom generation completes
- FFTW wisdom dialog: progress reports after each plan, breathing animation, auto-close messaging

### Platform Firmware Mapping
All consumer FlexRadios (Microburst/DeepEddy/BigBend/Aurora) use FLEX-6x00 firmware. Only DragonFire (FLEX-9600) uses separate firmware.

## [v0.4.7a] — 2026-03-18


Minor UX improvements to the NR2 spectral noise reduction feature introduced in v0.4.7.

### NR Button 3-State Cycle
The NR button in the RX Applet now cycles through three states:
- **Off** → click → **NR** (radio-side noise reduction)
- **NR** → click → **NR2** (client-side spectral noise reduction)
- **NR2** → click → **Off**

The button label changes to show which mode is active. NR and NR2 are never on simultaneously — the radio's NR is automatically disabled when switching to NR2.

### Wisdom Dialog Improvements
- Progress bar now advances **after** each FFT plan completes, not before — no more false 100% while the last plan is still computing
- Description label shows which plan is being computed during slow phases ("Computing COMPLEX-TO-REAL FFT size 262144...")
- Breathing opacity animation on the dialog when progress >= 90% (the slow phase) so users know it's still working
- "Wisdom generation complete!" confirmation before auto-close
- Light text on progress bar readable at all fill levels

### NR2 Button Sync
All three NR2 controls (VFO widget, DSP side panel, RxApplet) now stay in sync and only show "on" after wisdom generation completes and NR2 is actually processing audio.

### DSP Side Panel
- NR2 toggle button added to the left-side DSP overlay panel
- DSP panel top-aligned with button menu

### Downloads
Pre-built binaries auto-attach when CI completes (~5 min).

## [v0.4.7] — 2026-03-18


### NR2 Spectral Noise Reduction (contributed by @EI6JGB)

Client-side spectral noise reduction using the Ephraim-Malah MMSE Log-Spectral Amplitude estimator with OSMS noise floor tracking. This is a sophisticated DSP algorithm that complements the radio's built-in NR — particularly effective on weak signals where the radio's NR alone isn't enough.

**Features:**
- Toggle NR2 in the VFO widget DSP panel
- FFTW3 optimized FFTs with automatic radix-2 fallback when FFTW3 isn't installed
- Background FFTW wisdom generation — audio continues playing during optimization
- 1-second startup ramp for smooth transition as the noise estimator converges
- Anti-musical-noise temporal gain smoothing
- Decision-directed a priori SNR estimation with speech presence probability
- CPU cost: ~1-2% of one core at 24kHz mono processing

**Dependencies (optional):**
- Linux: `libfftw3-dev` (falls back to built-in FFT without it)
- macOS: `brew install fftw`
- Windows: bundled in `third_party/fftw3/`

Thank you @EI6JGB for this excellent contribution — real DSP engineering with proper overlap-add processing, Hann windowing, and numerical stability.

### Firmware Uploader

Update your radio's firmware directly from Linux — no Windows machine required.

- Settings → Radio Setup → Radio tab → Firmware Update section
- Browse for .ssdr firmware files
- Progress bar with chunked TCP upload
- Confirmation dialog with model verification
- Automatic port fallback (4995 → 42607)

The .ssdr files can be obtained from an existing SmartSDR installation (`C:\ProgramData\FlexRadio Systems\SmartSDR\Updates\`).

## [v0.3.90-beta] — 2026-03-17


**This is a beta release.** SmartLink TCP command channel is fully working. UDP streaming (FFT, waterfall, audio) needs community testing.

### What's New: SmartLink

Operate your FlexRadio remotely over the internet — no VPN required.

**Working:**
- Log in with your FlexRadio SmartSDR+ account (email/password)
- Radio auto-discovered via SmartLink server
- Full TCP command channel: tune, change modes, adjust filters, all controls work
- Unified radio list shows both local (LAN) and remote (SmartLink) radios
- Stable TLS connection with automatic keepalive

**Needs Testing (call for testers!):**
- UDP streaming (FFT spectrum, waterfall, audio) over WAN
- We confirmed TCP works but UDP packets aren't arriving through carrier NAT (T-Mobile)
- **We need testers with home WiFi remote access** (not mobile hotspot) to verify UDP works with proper port forwarding
- Port forwarding required: TCP 4994 + UDP 4993 to radio's LAN IP

### How to Test SmartLink

1. **At home:** Enable SmartLink in SmartSDR → Settings → SmartLink Setup
2. **Forward ports:** TCP 4994 and UDP 4993 to your radio's LAN IP
3. **Test ports:** Click "Test" in SmartSDR's SmartLink Setup — both should be green
4. **Remote:** Build AetherSDR on a remote machine, log in with your FlexRadio account
5. **Report:** Share results in [Discussions](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/discussions) — especially if FFT/waterfall/audio works!

### Requirements
- SmartSDR+ subscription (for SmartLink access)
- Port forwarding on home router (TCP 4994, UDP 4993)
- FlexRadio with SmartLink enabled and registered

## [v0.3.0] — 2026-03-17


### Profile Management
Full profile management matching SmartSDR's Profiles menu:

**Profiles menu** (menu bar):
- Dynamic list of global profiles loaded from radio
- Active profile marked with checkmark
- Click to instantly load a global profile

**Profile Manager dialog** (Profiles → Profile Manager...):
- **Global tab**: Load, Save, Delete global profiles with name entry field
- **Transmit tab**: Manage TX profiles
- **Microphone tab**: Manage mic profiles
- **Auto-Save tab**: Toggle auto-save for TX/mic profile changes
- Lists refresh in real-time as the radio processes changes
- Delete confirmation dialog
- Double-click to load

### Critical Bug Fixes

**Profile load crash (SEGV)**: Loading a global profile that changes the slice caused a segfault in `AppletPanel::setSlice()` — the old SliceModel was deleted but its pointer wasn't cleared before disconnect. Fixed by nulling all slice pointers in `onSliceRemoved` before re-wiring.

**No audio after profile load**: After loading a profile, the radio destroys and recreates the slice, invalidating the old `remote_audio_rx` stream. The radio rejected duplicate stream creation with `5000008e`. Fixed by removing the old stream before creating a new one, chained via callback.

**No FFT after profile load**: The `m_panResized` flag wasn't reset when a slice was removed, preventing the panadapter from re-syncing with the radio's new display settings.

## [v0.2.4] — 2026-03-16


### Bug Fix: Band Memory Deprecated
Per-band settings persistence has been temporarily disabled pending a full redesign (#9). The automatic band-crossing detection was incorrectly saving state during connection, causing 80m/40m band buttons to tune to 20m instead (#8). 

Band switching still works — clicking a band button tunes to the correct default frequency and mode. Per-band memory (remembering antenna, zoom, filter settings per band) will return in a future release with a more robust design.

### TX Settings Tab
New TX tab in the Radio Setup dialog:
- ACC TX, RCA TX1/TX2/TX3 timing delays
- TX Profile dropdown (populated from radio)
- RCA/Accessory interlock polarity settings
- Max Power limit (editable, 0-100%)
- Tune Mode selector (Single Tone / Two Tone)
- Show TX in Waterfall toggle

---

## [v0.2.3] — 2026-03-16


### Bug Fix
- **Band menu tuning to wrong frequency** — Clicking 80m or 40m would sometimes tune to 20m instead. The band-crossing detection was incorrectly saving state during initial connection. Fixed by guarding with `m_updatingFromModel` flag. Stale band memory is automatically cleared on first launch of v0.2.3. (#8)

### Settings Dialog
- **Settings menu** added between File and View (Radio Setup, Network, FlexControl, multiFLEX, etc.)
- **Radio Setup** — Radio tab with serial number, callsign, nickname (editable), region, HW version, options, Remote On/multiFLEX toggles
- **Network tab** — IP address, subnet mask, MAC address, DHCP/Static IP configuration with Apply button, Enforce Private IP toggle
- **GPS tab** — Installed status, latitude/longitude, grid square, altitude, satellite tracked/visible, speed, freq error, UTC time

### Other
- macOS build support (Homebrew portaudio link path fix)
- Desktop integration (.desktop file + cmake install rules)
- System UTC clock fallback when no GPS installed
- DAX/Hamlib added to roadmap (#7)

## [v0.2.2] — 2026-03-16


### Bug Fix: Multi-Client (Multi-Flex) Support

AetherSDR now operates correctly when another client (SmartSDR, Maestro) is already connected to the radio. Previously, connecting AetherSDR as a second client would cause:

- Waterfall displaying all red (processing the other client's FFT data)
- Zoom/scale changes replicating between clients
- Both clients tuning in sync (sharing the same slice)

**Fix:** Three-layer filtering by `client_handle`:
1. **Slice ownership** — only tracks slices belonging to our client
2. **Display status** — only processes our panadapter/waterfall status updates
3. **VITA-49 packets** — only decodes FFT/waterfall data from our stream IDs

AetherSDR now creates its own independent slice and panadapter when connecting to a radio with existing clients, enabling true Multi-Flex operation.
