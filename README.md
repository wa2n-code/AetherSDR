AetherSDR brings FlexRadio operation to Linux without Wine or virtual machines. Built from the ground up with Qt6 and C++20, it speaks the SmartSDR protocol natively and aims to replicate the full SmartSDR experience.

**Current version: 0.7.18** | [Download](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/releases/latest) | [Discussions](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/discussions)

> **Cross-platform downloads available:** Linux AppImage, macOS universal DMG, Windows installer (.exe) and portable ZIP.
> Linux is the primary supported platform. macOS and Windows builds are provided as a courtesy
> but are unsupported and low priority until post-v1.0.

## Supported Radios

Tested with the **FLEX-8600** running v4.1.5 software. Should work with other FlexRadio models that use the SmartSDR protocol (FLEX-6000 series, FLEX-8000 series).

Linux is the primary development platform and receives the most testing. macOS and Windows
builds are provided as a convenience — they compile from the same codebase but are not
actively tested or supported. Bug reports are welcome but fixes for macOS/Windows issues
will be low priority until after v1.0.

## Building from Source

### Dependencies (Linux)

```bash
# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-multimedia cmake ninja pkgconf autoconf automake libtool

# Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian / Linux Mint / Elementary OS
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-multimedia-dev cmake ninja-build pkg-config \
  autoconf automake libtool gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
  libxkbcommon-dev portaudio19-dev libfftw3-dev

# Fedora
sudo dnf install qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtmultimedia-devel cmake ninja-build \
  autoconf automake libtool

# macOS (Homebrew)
brew install qt@6 ninja cmake pkgconf autoconf automake libtool
```

> **Linux Mint / Ubuntu note:** If PC audio devices show as "Dummy Output" or empty,
> install the GStreamer PulseAudio plugin: `sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio`.
> For PipeWire-based systems (Mint 22+, Ubuntu 24.04+), also install `gstreamer1.0-pipewire`.

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR.git
cd AetherSDR
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
./build/AetherSDR
```

The application will automatically discover FlexRadio transceivers on your local network.

### Install (optional, Linux)

Install the binary, desktop entry, and icon system-wide:

```bash
sudo cmake --install build
```

This places `AetherSDR` in `/usr/local/bin`, the `.desktop` file in the app launcher, and the icon in the system icon theme.

## Contributing

PRs, bug reports, and feature requests welcome! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

**Development environment:** AetherSDR is developed using [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) as the primary development tool. The entire codebase — architecture, conventions, and patterns — is built and maintained through AI-assisted development. To ensure consistency and minimize integration issues, **we strongly encourage all contributors to use Claude Code for development**. PRs must follow the project's established conventions, pass CI, and integrate cleanly with the existing architecture.

**Not a developer?** You can still contribute great feature requests using AI. See the [AI-Assisted Feature Requests](CONTRIBUTING.md#ai-assisted-feature-requests) section in our contributing guide — it walks you through using Claude.ai to turn your idea into a well-structured request that's easy for us to implement.

The codebase is modular — each subsystem (core protocol, models, GUI widgets) can be worked on independently. Check [Issues](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/issues) for current tasks.
