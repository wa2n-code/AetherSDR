AetherSDR brings FlexRadio operation to Linux without Wine or virtual machines. Built from the ground up with Qt6 and C++20, it speaks the SmartSDR protocol natively and aims to replicate the full SmartSDR experience.

**Current version: 0.8.21** | [Download](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/releases/latest) | [Discussions](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/discussions) | [What's New](https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR/releases)

> **Cross-platform downloads available:** Linux AppImage, macOS universal DMG, Windows installer and portable ZIP.
> Linux is the primary supported platform. macOS and Windows builds are provided as a courtesy.

## Highlights

- **GPU-accelerated rendering** — QRhi waterfall + FFT spectrum on GPU (OpenGL/Metal/D3D11), 71% CPU reduction, heat map FFT display
- **Multi-slice operation** — color-coded VFO overlays, independent TX assignment, diversity mode with ESC beamforming
- **Multi-panadapter** — up to 4 pans with 6 layout options, per-pan display controls, native VITA-49 waterfall tiles
- **Full RX/TX controls** — filter presets, AGC, DSP, EQ, mic/compression gauges, TX profiles, ATU, TUNE/MOX
- **Client-side noise reduction** — NR2 (spectral), RN2 (RNNoise neural), BNR (NVIDIA GPU AI denoiser)
- **CW decoder** — real-time Morse decode with auto pitch/speed detection and confidence coloring
- **SpotHub** — DX Cluster, RBN, WSJT-X, POTA, and FreeDV Reporter spots with density badges and auto-mode switch
- **DAX virtual audio** — 4 RX + 1 TX channels for WSJT-X, fldigi, VARA, JS8Call (Linux PulseAudio/PipeWire, macOS CoreAudio)

## Building from Source

### Dependencies

Install all dependencies for a full-featured build. Optional packages are noted — the build succeeds without them but the corresponding features are disabled.

```bash
# Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro
sudo pacman -S qt6-base qt6-multimedia qt6-websockets qt6-serialport \
  qt6-shadertools cmake ninja pkgconf autoconf automake libtool \
  fftw portaudio hidapi qtkeychain-qt6

# Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian / Linux Mint
sudo apt install qt6-base-dev qt6-base-private-dev qt6-multimedia-dev \

> **Linux Mint / Ubuntu note:** If PC audio devices show as "Dummy Output",
> install `gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio`. For PipeWire systems, also install `gstreamer1.0-pipewire`.

### Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ten9876/AetherSDR.git
cd AetherSDR
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
./build/AetherSDR
```

RADE-enabled builds use a vendored Opus snapshot, so no additional Opus download
is required during configure or build.

### Install (optional, Linux)

```bash
sudo cmake --install build
```
