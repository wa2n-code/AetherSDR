# FlexRadio Meter Learnings

This document captures the working conclusions from AetherSDR compression
meter debugging across FLEX-8000 series radios and a FLEX-6600. It is meant to
record capture-backed behavior, not API guesses.

Related implementation context lives in `docs/tx-audio-signal-path.md`.

## Core Rules

- Match meters by `source` and `name`, not by numeric ID. Flex meter IDs are
  assigned per session and differ by platform.
- Do not synthesize compression when required radio meters are unavailable. A
  missing compression input should make the compression meter unavailable, not
  approximate a value from local mic audio.
- This work preserves the existing Phone/CW gauge presentation. Availability is
  tracked in `MeterModel`; the UI still receives `0 dB` when no valid
  compression pair is available, rather than adding new N/A rendering.
- `COMPPEAK` is a dBFS signal-level tap near the speech processor/clipper. It
  is not, by itself, the SmartSDR compression display value.
- The AetherSDR P/CW compression gauge is reversed: `0 dB` means no visible
  compression and `-25 dB` means full-scale/heavy compression.

## Compression Formulas

### FLEX-8000 Series

The 8000-series model validated against SmartSDR uses `AFTEREQ` and
`COMPPEAK`:

```text
compression_lift_db = max(0, COMPPEAK - AFTEREQ)
display_db = -clamp(compression_lift_db, 0, 25)
```

`AFTEREQ` is the processor input reference after the TX equalizer. `COMPPEAK`
is the processor/clipper-stage tap. Both meters advertise `20 fps`, so the two
inputs are naturally well matched for a derived compression display.

If either meter is missing, AetherSDR should not show a derived compression
value.

### FLEX-6600 / 6000-Series Evidence

The captured FLEX-6600 manifest does not expose `AFTEREQ`. The relevant TX
meters observed were:

- `CODEC` as TX meter `21`
- `SC_MIC` as TX meter `22`
- `COMPPEAK` as TX meter `23`

The strongest candidate formula is:

```text
compression_lift_db = max(0, COMPPEAK - SC_MIC)
display_db = -clamp(compression_lift_db, 0, 25)
```

Why this is the current model:

- Raw `COMPPEAK` does not behave like the SmartSDR compression display. In
  strong RF-output rows it often goes positive and would clamp to `0 dB`, just
  when compression should be visible.
- The opposite direction, `SC_MIC - COMPPEAK`, was effectively dead in the
  user captures and stayed at `0 dB`.
- `CODEC` is a plausible alternate reference, but in the 6600 captures it was
  consistently about 3 dB lower than `SC_MIC`, which would make
  `COMPPEAK - CODEC` read slightly heavier. `SC_MIC` is the better named
  pre-processor mic-chain reference.

The remaining engineering caution is timing. On the 6600, `SC_MIC` advertises
`10 fps` while `COMPPEAK` advertises `20 fps`. AetherSDR guards the derived
6600 compression value by requiring the reference sample and `COMPPEAK` sample
to be close in time before marking the compression meter available.

## P/CW Level Meter

The P/CW level meter is intentionally separate from the compression derivation.
The FPS-testing experiment that drove voice/CW level strictly from `SC_MIC` was
backed out. Current behavior keeps the existing UI path: hardware mic meters
for hardware inputs, and client-side PC metering for PC audio. The Phone/CW
level gauge and `HGauge`/`MeterSmoother` dampening are not changed by the
compression work.

`SC_MIC` is used as a 6000-series compression reference only when `AFTEREQ` is
not present. It is not used as a strict replacement for the P/CW level meter.

## Two-Tone Tune Observations

Two-tone tune is useful for producing deterministic RF output and checking the
radio-side signal path. During two-tone testing, the transmitted RF can contain
only the radio-generated two-tone audio even while local PC mic meters move.
For this reason, AetherSDR should not use local mic activity to drive the
compression gauge.

The current implementation does not add special UI behavior for two-tone tune;
this note records why future work should be careful not to derive compression
from local mic activity during radio-generated test tones.

## Open Questions

- Confirm the 6600 scale against SmartSDR with a capture that includes the
  visible SmartSDR Comp reading at the same time as `SC_MIC` and `COMPPEAK`.
